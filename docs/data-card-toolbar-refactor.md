- clean up the styles, it seems like they they duplicate each other for the individual buttons
- figure out how to let the settings dictate the order of the buttons
- figure out how to disable the image button
- improve the link button (this button is going to go away so this is kind of waste)
- move the image upload button into the shared components folder

Bonus
- fix the disabling to use aria-disabled and check the tab behavior
