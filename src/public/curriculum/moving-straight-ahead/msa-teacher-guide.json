They looked at both consistent relationships (such as linear patterns) and non-consistent relationships to explain the pattern of change between two variables.\n\nThe four questions in the introduction to the Investigation offer overarching questions that the students should explore throughout the unit. You may want to display these questions in the classroom in some way to help keep students focused on the big ideas in the Unit.<ul><li> How can you determine whether a relationship is linear by examining a table of data? A graph? An equation? A verbal context?</li><li> If the relationship is linear, how can you determine if it is a proportional relationship?</li><li> How do changes in one variable affect changes in a related variable? How are these changes represented in a table, graph, or equation?</li><li> If I know the value of one variable, how can I find the value of the other variable? </li></ul>After setting the scene for the Unit with the four questions, begin to introduce students to the context of the Problem."

Describe the experiment. \n\nGive each group access to meter sticks (or a pre-set measurement of 10 meters) and a timer or a clock with seconds. Students should do the experiment twice to get a more accurate walking rate. They can choose either the rate they want or the average of the two.

Graphs are useful because they give you a sense of the pattern’s behavior over a wide range of values, which is helpful for estimating.

Students might describe this as the rate of change. They should realize that this could be zero (as with Leanne) or negative (as with Ms. Chang and Mr. Mamer). They may realize that the rate of change can be measured anywhere on the graph or table. A linear relationship can be represented by the equation y = ax + b. The point where the line crosses the y-axis is b, the y-intercept. The rate of change is represented by a. If b is 0, then the relationship is also proportional. In a linear and proportional relationship, the rate of change is also a unit rate that is the constant of proportionality.

Positive values of a give lines that slant up. Negative values of a give lines that slant down. The value of b gives the y-intercept of the line. It is represented as the point (0, b) on the line or the pair of values in a table.

                          "<code>If you have an equation of the form y = ax + b and you know the value of x or y, you can substitute the value of the variable into the equation. Then, use the properties of equality to solve for the other variable. For example, if y = 3x + 4 and you want to find x when y = 10, then you substitute 10 in place of y: 10 = 3x + 4. Next, you can subtract 4 from both sides to get 6 = 3x. Now, divide both sides by 3 to get x = 2.\nFor the equation y = 3x + 4, to find the value of x when y = 10, you can graph the equation. Trace along the line to find the point whose y-coordinate is 10 and then read the corresponding x-value, which is 2. To use a table, construct a table of values for the equation either by hand or with graphing technology. Next, locate the pair of values in which y = 10 and find the corresponding x-value, which is 2.\nTo find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 < 10, you can solve the corresponding equation 3x + 4 = 10. The solution of this equation is x = 2. Then, test values less than and greater than 2 to determine the solution. In this case, x-values less than 2 make the inequality 3x + 4 < 10 true, so the solution is x < 2.\nTo find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 < 10, you can graph the corresponding linear relationship y = 3x + 4. Then, find the points on the line whose y-values are less than 10. You can also locate the x-values of these points on the x-axis or on a number line.\nIn Problem 3.2, Equation 1 two equivalent expressions for the number of pouches on the left side of the equation are 4x + 2 and 2(2x + 1). You can use the properties of operations to show that they are equivalent. Applying the Distributive Property to one of the expressions yields the other: 4x + 2 = 2(2x + 1). You can also argue that both of the expressions represent the number of pouches and coins in the picture.\nIn Problem 3.3, Set 3(a), two equivalent ways of writing the expression on the left side of the equation are 3(x + 1) and 3x + 3. You can tell they are equivalent because the equations 3(x + 1) = 21 and 3x + 3 = 21 have the same solution, even though you would take different steps when solving them. (To solve the first equation, you would divide each side by 3 and then subtract 1 from each side. To solve the second equation, you would subtract 3 from each side and then divide each side by 3. The solution for both equations is x = 6.)</code>"

                          "<code>Slope describes the steepness of a line. It is the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change. If it is positive, then the line is increasing from left to right. If it is negative, then it is decreasing from left to right. If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal. This is like walking on a flat surface as opposed to up or down a hill.\nFinding the slope is the same as finding the rate of change between two variables in a linear relationship. The horizontal distance change between two points is the same as the difference between two corresponding x-values of points in a table. The vertical change in distance is the same as the difference between two corresponding y-values of points in a table.</code>"
