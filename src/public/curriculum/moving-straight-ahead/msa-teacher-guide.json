In that Unit, students used contextual situations, tables, graphs, and equations to represent patterns relating variables such as cost, income, and profit. They looked at both consistent relationships (such as linear patterns) and non-consistent relationships to explain the pattern of change between two variables.\n\nThe four questions in the introduction to the Investigation offer overarching questions that the students should explore throughout the unit. You may want to display these questions in the classroom in some way to help keep students focused on the big ideas in the Unit.<ul><li> How can you determine whether a relationship is linear by examining a table of data? A graph? An equation? A verbal context?</li><li> If the relationship is linear, how can you determine if it is a proportional relationship?</li><li> How do changes in one variable affect changes in a related variable? How are these changes represented in a table, graph, or equation?</li><li> If I know the value of one variable, how can I find the value of the other variable? </li></ul>After setting the scene for the Unit with the four questions, begin to introduce students to the context of the Problem.",

Alana’s line is the lowest or least steep or has the smallest angle from the x-axis.

(Between Leanne’s and Gilberto’s, because for every one second that you walk, you would travel 2.3 meters, 2 seconds would be 4.6 meters, etc.)</li><li> What is the equation for Alana? (d = 1t) Gilberto? (d = 2t) Leanne? (d = 2.5t) How did you find it? (Various answers. For example, to find the distance we multiply by the walking rate.)</li><li> If you increased your walking rate, what effect would that have on your table or graph?

(The variables for George, Elizabeth, and Billie are time and distance. The variables for Evo are not labeled. The variables for Bob are time t in seconds and walking rate r in meters per second.) </li><li> Describe the patterns of change between the two variables. How did you find the pattern? (For Elizabeth, for every increase of 2 seconds, the distance increases by 3 meters. Each row of the table increases by the same number of seconds. For Billie, for every 1 second, the distance increases by 2.25 meters. The equation is in the form d = rt, so the walking rate is the same as the value of r. For George, distance increases with time, but there does not seem to be a pattern. For Bob, as rate increases, time decreases.) </li><li> Describe what is happening in each situation. (According to the table, George is not walking at a constant rate. Elizabeth is walking at a constant rate and is using an interval of 2 seconds. If Evo’s represents time and distance, she walked at a consistent rate, stopped for some time, then walked again at a consistent rate. Billie is also walking at a constant rate because the equation is similar to those for Alana, Gilberto, and Leanne. Bob is walking 100 meters, but the rate and time are not known. His walking rate may or may not be constant because the variables are time and rate, not time and distance.) </li><li> After 5 seconds, who is ahead? (According to the table, George walks 25 meters in 5 seconds. In that time, Elizabeth walks 7.5 meters, and Billie walks 11.25 meters. (Note: Using the equation for Bob, a time of 5 seconds results in a rate of 20 m/s, which is not a realistic walking rate.) </li></ul>The table of Elizabeth’s time and distance represents a linear relationship, but students need to note that time is not increasing by an interval of 1 second. Go back to the idea of writing the rate as a unit rate, as discussed earlier in this section. <ul><li> For those that are linear, compare the walking rates to those of the original three students. Who is the fastest? Who is the slowest? (Elizabeth walks 3 meters for every 2 seconds, or 1.5 meters per second. This is faster than Alana but slower than Gilberto. Billie walks 2.25 meters per second, which is faster than Alana and Gilberto but slower than Leanne. Since Leanne is still the fastest, her graph is the steepest.)</li></ul> Conclude by discussing the ideas of being linear and proportional.<ul><li> Was every relationship in this problem linear? Explain. (No. The data for George, Bob, and Evo were not linear.)</li><li> Were the linear relationships in this problem proportional? (Yes. If we used values from the table or points from the graph, we could write proportions.)</li><li> How can you tell if a graph does not represent a linear relationship? (A graph represents a linear relationship if it is one straight line. Therefore, if the graph is not a straight line, the relationship it models is not linear.) </li><li> How can you tell if a table does not represent a linear relationship? (A table does not represent a linear relationship if for each unit change in the independent variable, there is not a constant change in the dependent variable.) </li><li> How can you tell if an equation represents a linear relationship? (Various answers. At this time, students’ experiences are limited. Students may identify that there is a number multiplied by one variable to get values for the other variable.) </li></ul>"

The Problem furthers students’ understanding of rate of change between the two variables in a linear relationship. Students will compare the amount of money donated and the distance walked for a walkathon. Students see linear relationships in a new context and interpret information using verbal descriptions, tables, graphs, and equations. They also informally explore the y-intercept."

(If you know how much a sponsor pledges to donate and how far the student plans to walk, you can figure out how much each student might collect from each sponsor. For example, if the sponsor pledges to donate $4 for each kilometer walked, and the student plans to walk 5 kilometers, then you can estimate that the student will collect 4 * 5 = $20 from each sponsor.)  </li><li>Will the amount of money raised be the same for each walker? Explain. (No. The amount of money raised might depend on the distance that each student walks, as well as his or her pledge plan, so the amount of money raised may not be the same for each walker.)  </li><li>Which variable is the independent variable?

Students may choose to use numerical reasoning, tables, graphs, or equations. Question students to explain their methods used to find when the two cost plans are equal. You may want to orchestrate the Summary so that at least one student presents Situation B #1 and #2 with table, another student with graph, and a third student with equation to reinforce how to use each representation.\n\nYou can use student reasoning, the representations, and the What If...? questions to clarify points that students do not discuss.\n\n<strong>Suggested Questions</strong><ul><li>What is the cost per T-shirt under each plan? (The cost per T-shirt is $1 for Mighty Tee and $4.50 for No-Shrink Tee.)</li><li>How would this rate show up in a table? In a graph? (As the value in the column for the number of T-shirts increases by 1, the value for cost increases by $1 for Mighty Tee and $4.50 for No-Shrink Tee. The graph of the line for No-Shrink Tee is much steeper than the graph of the line for Mighty Tee.)</li><li>What information does the y-intercept represent in each equation? (The y-intercept represents the cost of 0 T-shirts. It is the starting cost for each company.)</li><li>For what number of T‐shirts are the two costs equal? How did you find that number? (14 T‐shirts; students may have made a table and found the row for which the two costs are equal, constructed a graph and identified the intersection point, or used a method involving guess and check.)</li><li>Why is it important to know when the costs are equal? (You can tell when the companies charge the same amount for the same number of t-shirts. Before or beyond that point, the one company is cheaper than the other.)</li><li>In Situation C, what do the numbers 0 and 34 mean in the table? (That must be a set-up fee or shipping cost or some other fee just to order from them. It is the y-intercept.)</li><li>Is the relationship in Situation C linear? (Yes.) What is the coefficient in the equation? (The rate of change for the shirts is as you add 3 shirts is costs $7.50 more or as you add 2 shirts is costs $5.00 more. This would mean that the cost for 1 each new t-shirt is $2.50. So, the coefficient is 2.5.)</li><li>How could we write the equation for The Big Tee company? (Cost = y-intercept + coefficient times n or CBig Tee = 34 + 2.5n.)</li></ul>"]

(Various answers. Students might say that that cost is not linear which makes it more difficult to compare.)</li><li>Which representation seems most convenient for solving this Problem? (Answers will vary. Students may give reasons for each representation. At this stage in their development, they might say that equations are most convenient because the row you need to answer a question might not be in the table, or the point on the line you need might not be shown on a graph. They may also explain that graphs can be easily traced to find the missing value of an ordered pair. Finally, they may point out that tables usually require no calculations to find pairs of values.)</li><li>How can you compare which company is a better deal when they all have different ways of charging for the shirts? (Consider different the cost for different numbers of shirts. It is important to know when the costs are the same for either company. This tells you the point where one company will begin to cost more than the other.)</li><li>In Situation B #4, what question do you think someone was trying to answer by writing the inequality C<sub>Mighty</sub> < C<sub>No-Shrink</sub>? (How many t-shirts can I buy and pay less with the Mighty Tee company.) Note that students will solve inequalities symbolically later in the unit.</li><li>If I know how much money I have to spend, how can I find how many t-shirts I can buy from the different companies?</li><li>In a linear situation, describe how you can find a value of a variable if the value of the other variable is known. (Answers will vary. Sample answer: For an equation, if the independent variable is known, you can substitute its value into the equation and then evaluate the resulting expression. If the dependent variable is known, you can substitute its value into the equation and then solve the equation to find the corresponding value of the independent variable. With a graph, follow the vertical line on the grid if the independent variable is known, or the horizontal line if the dependent variable is known, until it hits the line. Then, follow the other direction to find the other quantity.)</li><li>What does it mean for relationships to be proportional? The equation is of the form <em>y = mx</em>, like the cost at No-Shrink. The relationship is proportional to the number of T-shirts. So, if you double the number of T-shirts, you also double the cost. You cannot do this with Mighty, because is it not proportional.)</li><li>How can you tell if relationships are linear? (Various answers. Table representation: as the x variable increases by a consistent amount, the y variable also increases by a consistent amount. Graph: A straight line is formed. Equation: The equation fits the form of <em>y = ax</em>, <em>y = ax + b</em>, or <em>y = b + ax</em>.)</li></ul>"]

(Plan 1: +5 dollars per kilometer; Plan 2: -1 dollar per kilometer; Plan 3: +0 dollars per kilometer)   </li><li>How does each rate appear in a table? In a graph? In an equation? (In a table, the rate is the constant change in the amount of money raised when the number of kilometers increases by 1. In a graph, the rate is the steepness of the line. In an equation, the rate is the coefficient of x.)  </li><li>What information does the y-intercept represent in each plan? (The y-intercept represents the amount of money a sponsor donates for 0 kilometers walked. If the person did not walk at all, he or she would still raise an amount of money equal to the y-intercept.)   </li><li>Do the plans make sense? Explain. (Answers may vary. Sample answers: Plan 1 makes sense because the walker is asking each sponsor to donate $5 per kilometer and then gives the sponsor something that costs $3, such as a T-shirt. Plan 2 does not make sense because the amount of money raised should not decrease as the number of kilometers walked increases. Plan 3 makes sense because the walker raises $2 from each sponsor regardless of the distance walked, which is similar to Leanne’s plan in Problem 1.3.)  </li></ul>"

                      "text": "Let students share their ideas with the main focus on the rate, intercepts of the graphs, and solutions of the equations. Most students will say that the negative rate does not make sense. It means you give money back. However, students are very creative and may suggest something plausible. Another suggestion could be that the walker for Plan 2 collects $6 and promises to walk 15 kilometers. If she does not walk the 15 km, then she will pay back $1 for each kilometer she does not walk. In this case, it is necessary to change what the variable <em>x</em> represents to the number of kilometers <em>not</em> walked.\n\nPlan 2 is linear, decreasing, and not proportional. Can a linear relationship be decreasing and still be proportional? (Yes. It would not make sense for a pledge plan because we would lose money the more we walked. An example graph could contain the points: (0,0), (1,-2), (2,-4), (3,-6), (4, -8), etc.)"

This provides a transition into solving equations symbolically.\n\nStudents use the fact that the number of coins on both sides of the equation is equal to find the number of coins in a pouch. In the process, they find that there is more than one way to represent the number of coins on one side of the equation.

(The point (3, 6.5) means that d = 3 and A = 6.5, so 6.5 = 5 + 0.5(3) is a true statement. Similarly, for (30, 20), 20 = 5 + 0.5(30) is also true.) </li><li>We say that (3, 6.5) and (30, 20) are solutions to the equation A = 5 + 0.5d. Find another point on the line whose coordinates are a solution to the equation. (Be sure students explain why they are solutions—substitute the values into the equation and check if the resulting equation is true. Students can find other solutions by choosing a value for d or A and finding the corresponding value of the other variable.) </li><li>Do you think every point on the line corresponds to a solution to the equation? (Yes, although some values may not be realistic. For example, (100, 55) is not realistic because 100 km is an unreasonable distance for a student to walk in a walkathon.)  </li></ul>",

(Draw the vertical and horizontal lines corresponding to the coordinates of the point.)  </li><li>Find a pair of corresponding values in the table that are solutions to the equation. (Students may have to extend the table.)   </li><li>Write two questions about Alana’s pledge plan that could be answered by the coordinates of the point (14, 12). (Students can say either “How far did Alana walk if a sponsor donates +12?” or “How much money would a sponsor donate if Alana walked 14 kilometers?”)   </li><li>How can you use the equation for Alana’s plan to check the answer to the question you made up? (You can substitute d = 14 and A = 12 into the equation A = 5 + 0.5d. If the resulting equation is true, then (14, 12) is a solution.)   </li><li>How can you use a graph to find the number of kilometers that Alana walked if a sponsor donated $17? (You go to 17 on the vertical axis and move straight across horizontally until you intersect the line. Then, move directly down until you intersect the horizontal axis. The value you hit on the horizontal axis is the number of kilometers walked.)   </li><li>How can you use a graph to solve 20 = 5 + 0.5d? What would the answer mean? (Go to 20 on the vertical axis and move horizontally until you intersect the line. Read the “d” value at that point. This gives the distance Alana must walk in order to raise $20 from each sponsor.)  </li><li>What happens if you choose a point that is not visible on this section of the graph, such as (70, 40)? Does this point lie on the line? Explain. (Students might suggest extending the line. Some might suggest checking to see if the coordinates of the point make the equation a true statement.)   </li></ul>"

(Generally, you want to isolate the variable [pouch] on one side of the equation and a number [coins] on the other side. To do this, you can use properties of equality or “undo” the operations until you have the variable alone on one side of the equality and a number on the other side. You use the number that the variable equals to check your solution. You substitute the number  for the value of the variable in the original equation to see if you have a true statement.)</li></ul>",
                      "<p>Students should be able to generalize that adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing by the same number maintains equality. Be sure to stress that they cannot multiply or divide by 0. Dividing by 0 has no meaning and multiplying by 0 would make any statement always true, so it is not a helpful strategy in finding a specific solution. For example, suppose we start with 3b = 27, which we know is true only when b = 9. Multiplying each side by 0 gives 3b * 0 = 9 * 0, or 0 * 0. This statement is true for all values of the variable, not just 9. So multiplying both sides by 0 gives an equality that is not equivalent to the original equation because it has different solutions. If you have not already addressed the common error of subtracting when dividing is needed, do so now.</p>",

In fact, for all values of <em>n</em> that are greater than 14, the graph of <em>C</em><sub><em>mighty</em></sub> is below the graph of <em>C</em><sub><em>No-Shrink</em></sub>.

(Answers will vary.)</li><li>If you put a board on steep stairs and rode down on a skateboard, how would that compare to doing the same thing on stairs that are not steep? (Answers will vary.)</li><li>Does the steepness of a set of stairs affect the exercise? (Yes. The steeper the stairs, the more difficult they are to climb, and the more exercise you get while climbing them.) </li><li>Do all stairs have the same steepness? How can we determine the steepness? (No. Some stairs are steeper than others. We can determine the steepness by measuring the stairs.) </li><li>How can you describe the steepness of the stairs? (The steepness of stairs depends on how tall each step is (the height) and on the distance from the edge of the step to the next step (the width). So really tall steps where the flat part you step on isn’t very wide will make for a really steep set of stairs.) </li><li>Is the steepness the same between any two consecutive steps? (Yes. It seems like the steepness would be the same because you would want all the steps to be consistent. So the steepness between the consecutive steps should be the same.) </li></ul>",

Mathematically, you can tell that some stairs are steeper than others if their rise-to-run ratios are different.) </li><li>What is the steepest set of stairs in our list? The least steep set of stairs? How do you know? (Answers will vary based on student measurements. Students should be able to justify their answers, though, by comparing the ratios of rise to run. The stairs with the greatest ratio are the steepest, and the stairs with the least ratio are the least steep.) </li><li>Can you order the entire list of stairs from least to greatest in terms of steepness? (Yes. You can do this by ordering their ratios from least to greatest.) </li></ul>",

(Answers will vary, but they should be reasonably close. If not, discuss possible reasons for large deviations.) </li><li>What do you think influences a builder’s decision on the run of a set of steps? (Answers will vary. Students may suggest that handicap requirements, wider run to accommodate items such as planters, and aesthetics may influence a builder’s design.) </li><li>What do you think influences a builder’s decision on the rise of a set of steps? (A builder may consider how high a person of average height can comfortably step when deciding on the rise of a set of stairs. In these questions, students should be making comparisons using the ratio of the rise to the run.) </li><li>Now let’s think about another common object that you have climbed—a ladder. How can you use what you have learned so far to help make sense of steepness as it applies to ladders? What would make a ladder feel steep and what would make the same ladder feel less steep? (The angle of the ladder against the house will affect the rise, so it will affect how easy or difficult the ladder is to climb.) </li><li>Looking at the Initial Challenge, is the steepness the same between any two consecutive steps?  (Yes. Illustrate the point by superimposing a graph on stairs showing points on the front edges.) Use Teaching Aid 4.1: Stairs on a Graph.  </li></ul>",

So they do fit the carpenter guidelines.)</li><li>Are the points on the steps in a straight line?  (The points do lie on a straight line.)</li><li>Is the relationship between the rise and run a linear relationship? (The points do lie on a straight line. The relationship is r = 2R, which is linear. There would be a constant rate of change if we created a table.)</li><li>How is finding points on this line related to sketching a staircase with a rise-to-run ratio of 3 to 5? (Going from one point to another on the line is similar to moving 3 units vertically and then moving 5 units horizontally.) </li><li>Sketch a line that does not meet the carpenters’ guidelines.

Students might describe this as the rate of change. They should realize that this could be zero (as with Leanne) or negative (as with Ms. Chang and Mr. Mamer). They may realize that the rate of change can be measured anywhere on the graph or table. A linear relationship can be represented by the equation y = ax + b. The point where the line crosses the y-axis is b, the y-intercept. The rate of change is represented by a. If b is 0, then the relationship is also proportional. In a linear and proportional relationship, the rate of change is also a unit rate that is the constant of proportionality.
