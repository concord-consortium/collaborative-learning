They looked at both consistent relationships (such as linear patterns) and non-consistent relationships to explain the pattern of change between two variables.\n\nThe four questions in the introduction to the Investigation offer overarching questions that the students should explore throughout the unit. You may want to display these questions in the classroom in some way to help keep students focused on the big ideas in the Unit.<ul><li> How can you determine whether a relationship is linear by examining a table of data? A graph? An equation? A verbal context?</li><li> If the relationship is linear, how can you determine if it is a proportional relationship?</li><li> How do changes in one variable affect changes in a related variable? How are these changes represented in a table, graph, or equation?</li><li> If I know the value of one variable, how can I find the value of the other variable? </li></ul>After setting the scene for the Unit with the four questions, begin to introduce students to the context of the Problem."

Describe the experiment. \n\nGive each group access to meter sticks (or a pre-set measurement of 10 meters) and a timer or a clock with seconds. Students should do the experiment twice to get a more accurate walking rate. They can choose either the rate they want or the average of the two. Make sure there is a person checking the time in each group. As the groups finish collecting their data, they can work on the questions in the What If…? questions. "

If you increased your walking rate, how would it change your equation, graph, and table? (Students may not be able to answer at this time. Possible answer includes: If you increase the rate at which you walk, you can cover more distance in a given time. The distance in the table would increase for each second walked, and the graph would be steeper. Similarly, if you walk faster, it takes less time to cover a certain distance. The equation would have a larger number that multiplies by the variable.)\n\nNote that students are introduced to the word “coefficient” in the Grade 6 Unit Variables and Patterns. Since they may not have used the vocabulary term often in 6th grade, they are reintroduced to the term in Problem 2.2. While you may want to use that vocabulary earlier than Problem 2.2, the vocabulary term now might be too early for students. It helps students to have more experiences with the idea before the formal vocabulary is introduced. </li></ul>Look for students to make conjectures at this time. Tell students that they will investigate the effect of the walking rate on the relationship between distance and time by looking at the walking rates of three students. They will be asked to make a table, graph, and write an equation for each of the walkers. Students will examine these representations to see how changing the walking rate affects each representation of the data. They will relate the walking rate to the rate of change, linearity, and proportionality.\nTo maximize class time, you may want to provide each student with Labsheet 1.2."

The rate r is the coefficient of t, the number by which time is multiplied. The word coefficient is defined in the next Investigation. At this point, students will say it is the rate at which people walk, which is “the number that time is multiplied by to get the distance.” This is a good opportunity to discuss Situation A, #3 Yvonne’s Claim about proportionality.

(The variables for George, Elizabeth, and Billie are time and distance. The variables for Evo are not labeled. The variables for Bob are time t in seconds and walking rate r in meters per second.)  </li><li> Describe the patterns of change between the two variables. How did you find the pattern? (For Elizabeth, for every increase of 2 seconds, the distance increases by 3 meters. Each row of the table increases by the same number of seconds. For Billie, for every 1 second, the distance increases by 2.25 meters. The equation is in the form d = rt, so the walking rate is the same as the value of r. For George, distance increases with time, but there does not seem to be a pattern. For Bob, as rate increases, time decreases.)  </li><li> Describe what is happening in each situation. (According to the table, George is not walking at a constant rate. Elizabeth is walking at a constant rate and is using an interval of 2 seconds. If Evo’s represents time and distance, she walked at a consistent rate, stopped for some time, then walked again at a consistent rate. Billie is also walking at a constant rate because the equation is similar to those for Alana, Gilberto, and Leanne. Bob is walking 100 meters, but the rate and time are not known. His walking rate may or may not be constant because the variables are time and rate, not time and distance.)  </li><li> After 5 seconds, who is ahead? (According to the table, George walks 25 meters in 5 seconds. In that time, Elizabeth walks 7.5 meters, and Billie walks 11.25 meters. (Note: Using the equation for Bob, a time of 5 seconds results in a rate of 20 m/s, which is not a realistic walking rate.) </li></ul>The table of Elizabeth’s time and distance represents a linear relationship, but students need to note that time is not increasing by an interval of 1 second. Go back to the idea of writing the rate as a unit rate, as discussed earlier in this section. <ul><li> For those that are linear, compare the walking rates to those of the original three students. Who is the fastest? Who is the slowest? (Elizabeth walks 3 meters for every 2 seconds, or 1.5 meters per second. This is faster than Alana but slower than Gilberto. Billie walks 2.25 meters per second, which is faster than Alana and Gilberto but slower than Leanne. Since Leanne is still the fastest, her graph is the steepest.)</li></ul> Conclude by discussing the ideas of being linear and proportional.<ul><li> Was every relationship in this problem linear? Explain. (No. The data for George, Bob, and Evo were not linear.)</li><li> Were the linear relationships in this problem proportional? (Yes. If we used values from the table or points from the graph, we could write proportions.)</li><li> How can you tell if a graph does not represent a linear relationship? (A graph represents a linear relationship if it is one straight line. Therefore, if the graph is not a straight line, the relationship it models is not linear.)  </li><li> How can you tell if a table does not represent a linear relationship? (A table does not represent a linear relationship if for each unit change in the independent variable, there is not a constant change in the dependent variable.)  </li><li> How can you tell if an equation represents a linear relationship? (Various answers. At this time, students’ experiences are limited. Students may identify that there is a number multiplied by one variable to get values for the other variable.)  </li></ul>"

(If you know how much a sponsor pledges to donate and how far the student plans to walk, you can figure out how much each student might collect from each sponsor. For example, if the sponsor pledges to donate $4 for each kilometer walked, and the student plans to walk 5 kilometers, then you can estimate that the student will collect 4 * 5 = $20 from each sponsor.)\n\n  • Will the amount of money raised be the same for each walker? Explain. (No. The amount of money raised might depend on the distance that each student walks, as well as his or her pledge plan, so the amount of money raised may not be the same for each walker.)  \n\n• Which variable is the independent variable? Which is the dependent variable? (Distance walked is the independent variable, and the amount of money raised from each sponsor is the dependent variable.)  \n\nDisplay the three pledge plans of Leanne, Alana, and Gilberto.\n\n• How might you decide who is going to raise the most money?

Without the representations, it may be difficult to answer the questions with specific values. Students may make broad statements, such as saying that Leanne starts out making the most. Push students to find a value for when others might make more.\n\n<strong>Suggested Questions</strong>\n• Who starts out making the most? (Leanne)\n• Will she always make the most? How much would each person raise if they walked 20 kilometers? (Leanne - $10, Gilberto - $20, Alana - $15)\n• When did it change? At what distance does Leanne raise less than Gilberto? Less than Alana? (Leave students to think about these detailed questions.

How many kilometers does Alana need to walk if she wants each sponsor to donate $11?) \n\nThe preceding questions are designed to prepare students to solve equations symbolically. Later in this Unit, they will continue to relate coordinates of an ordered pair to specific information about the values of variables. \n\n<strong>Making the Mathematics Explicit </strong>In Comparing and Scaling, students observed that the rate tables relating cost of pizza to number of pizzas worked differently if a constant delivery charge was added. They noticed that there is a constant of proportionality (unit rate) when there is no delivery charge, but not a constant of proportionality (no unit rate) when there is a delivery charge. Here, students are learning about the specific details of linear relationships, in particular when are they proportional or not proportional and the role of the y-intercept. \n\n<strong>Suggested Questions </strong>\n• How are the tables, graphs, and equations for the pledge plans different from the walking rate representations? (Various answers. Students will probably mention the y-intercepts without knowing the term. They will discuss the “starting point” on the graph, the “beginning of the table or the (0,y)”, and the “amount added on in the equation.” It is typical for students to say that Leanne’s is a straight line and the others are not. Students need a way to express the horizontal line.)\n• Are the relationships between the distance walked and the money earned in pledges all linear? (Yes.) How do you know? (At this time, students are likely to say that the graphs are straight lines or that the data is consistent.)\n\nTo help students focus on determining the linearity and proportionality of the relationships, ask about the rate of change.\n\n<strong>Suggested Questions </strong>\n• How is the rate of change represented in a context? (At this time, students are likely to say it is the amount of money for every meter walked or the “per” or “per kilometer” amount.)"

(To be proportional, you have to have the two quantities change in a multiplicative way, keeping the factors and multiples of the quantities. When an amount is added, it gets spread over the dependent variable in a non-constant way. For example, with Leanne’s money amount, she will collect $10 for walking no kilometers, $10 for 1 kilometer, $5 for each of 2 kilometers, $3.33 for each of 3 kilometers, etc. The amount for every kilometer is not consistent.)\n\nDiscuss all of Situation B. The purpose of this question is to introduce students to a negative y-intercept. Make sure students discuss the variables and numbers in the equation and connect where the information shows up in the graph, table, and equation. \n\nAt the end of this Problem, students will have had experiences with y-intercepts that are positive, negative, or zero. The term y-intercept is introduced in the next Problem. It would be appropriate to name the y-intercepts while summarizing this Problem.\n\nCompare the representations in this Problem to the walkathon in Problem 1.2. All the relationships are linear, but the graphs in this Problem do not all pass through the origin, so they are not all proportional relationships. \n\n• In Problem 1.2, you noticed for Alana’s rate of 1 m/s that if she walked twice as long, her distance would also be twice as much. Would the amount of money she raises double if she walks twice as far? Explain. (No. The equation for Alana’s pledge plan is A = 5 + 0.5d, which is not a proportional relationship. The ratio between the money pledged and the distance walked is not constant even though the plan involves a constant rate of change.) \n\nThis idea will be revisited as students gain more experience with linear equations of the form y = ax + b.

This Problem is intended to show what knowledge students already have concerning linear relationships. \nBecause the Problem asks “how long” the race should be, some students will choose to focus on length and some will focus on time. \nStudents may suggest that once Emile is about to catch up to Henri, he can slow his walking rate so that Henri maintains the lead until the race is finished. If students give this suggestion, you can tell them to assume that each walking rate remains constant. There is a Launch Video to help students with the context of the race. \nHelp students imagine the race situation. (PROBLEM SOLVING)\n\n<strong>Suggested Questions</strong>\n<ul><li> What do we know about the race at the beginning? (Possible answer: The younger brother, Henri, has a head start. The brothers are not starting in the same spot.)</li><li> If you were watching this race, what would you see happening with the brothers? (Possible answer: The two brothers would start walking at the same time. The older brother, Emile, would be walking faster and would be catching up with each step. Some students may want to model what would happen with some physical movement.)</li></ul>Encourage students to think about how the race can be represented mathematically. Do not look for answers to these questions at this time. During the Explore and Summarize, listen and watch to see how students make sense of the situation.\n<ul><li> What data would you collect to document what happens in the race?</li><li> What are the variables that you would keep track of?</li><li> How could you represent the data to show what happens as they race?</li></ul>"]

By investigating the steepness of stairs, you can find another important way to describe the steepness of a line. \n\nCarpenters have developed the guidelines below to ensure that the stairs they build are relatively easy for a person to climb. Steps are measured in inches. \n\n  • Twice the rise plus the run for each step should be between 24 and 26 inches.\n  • The rise plus the run for each step should be between 17 and 19 inches.  \n\nThe steepness of stairs is determined by the ratio of the rise to the run for each step.

Students might describe this as the rate of change. They should realize that this could be zero (as with Leanne) or negative (as with Ms. Chang and Mr. Mamer). They may realize that the rate of change can be measured anywhere on the graph or table. A linear relationship can be represented by the equation y = ax + b. The point where the line crosses the y-axis is b, the y-intercept. The rate of change is represented by a. If b is 0, then the relationship is also proportional. In a linear and proportional relationship, the rate of change is also a unit rate that is the constant of proportionality.

                          "<code>If you have an equation of the form y = ax + b and you know the value of x or y, you can substitute the value of the variable into the equation. Then, use the properties of equality to solve for the other variable. For example, if y = 3x + 4 and you want to find x when y = 10, then you substitute 10 in place of y: 10 = 3x + 4. Next, you can subtract 4 from both sides to get 6 = 3x. Now, divide both sides by 3 to get x = 2.\nFor the equation y = 3x + 4, to find the value of x when y = 10, you can graph the equation. Trace along the line to find the point whose y-coordinate is 10 and then read the corresponding x-value, which is 2. To use a table, construct a table of values for the equation either by hand or with graphing technology. Next, locate the pair of values in which y = 10 and find the corresponding x-value, which is 2.\nTo find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 < 10, you can solve the corresponding equation 3x + 4 = 10. The solution of this equation is x = 2. Then, test values less than and greater than 2 to determine the solution. In this case, x-values less than 2 make the inequality 3x + 4 < 10 true, so the solution is x < 2.\nTo find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 < 10, you can graph the corresponding linear relationship y = 3x + 4. Then, find the points on the line whose y-values are less than 10. You can also locate the x-values of these points on the x-axis or on a number line.\nIn Problem 3.2, Equation 1 two equivalent expressions for the number of pouches on the left side of the equation are 4x + 2 and 2(2x + 1). You can use the properties of operations to show that they are equivalent. Applying the Distributive Property to one of the expressions yields the other: 4x + 2 = 2(2x + 1). You can also argue that both of the expressions represent the number of pouches and coins in the picture.\nIn Problem 3.3, Set 3(a), two equivalent ways of writing the expression on the left side of the equation are 3(x + 1) and 3x + 3. You can tell they are equivalent because the equations 3(x + 1) = 21 and 3x + 3 = 21 have the same solution, even though you would take different steps when solving them. (To solve the first equation, you would divide each side by 3 and then subtract 1 from each side. To solve the second equation, you would subtract 3 from each side and then divide each side by 3. The solution for both equations is x = 6.)</code>"
