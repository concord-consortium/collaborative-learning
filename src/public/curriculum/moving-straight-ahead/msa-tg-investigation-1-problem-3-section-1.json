            "A new situation involving collecting money from sponsors for the walkathon helps student compare and contrast proportional to non-proportional relationships. The Problem furthers studentsâ€™ understanding of rate of change between the two variables in a linear relationship. Students will compare the amount of money donated and the distance walked for a walkathon. Students see linear relationships in a new context and interpret information using verbal descriptions, tables, graphs, and equations. They also informally explore the y-intercept."
