            "<p>This Problem introduces students to symbolic ways of solving linear equations with one unknown. Equations are represented pictorially as coins (constant term) and pouches that hold an unknown number of coins (variables). Students explore the properties of equality pictorially as they find the number of coins in a pouch. This provides a transition into solving equations symbolically.</p>",
            "Students use the fact that the number of coins on both sides of the equation is equal to find the number of coins in a pouch. In the process, they find that there is more than one way to represent the number of coins on one side of the equation. This provides an opportunity to use equivalent expressions as part of a strategy for solving equations."
