You will find that they range from about 1 meter per second to 3 or 4 meters per second. But most students will cluster around 2 to 2.5 meters per second. Use one or two of the more typical walking rates to answer the questions in the Problem. \n\nIf students record their walking rates as both a rate and a ratio, ask how they are the same. You might ask students to write their walking rates in seconds per meter. If so, you can then ask questions to relate back to concepts in Comparing and Scaling."

            "<ul><li>How do you find how long it takes to walk a given distance, in particular, asking about 500 meters in situation A? (Note that this is informally solving for T when D is given. Students will have informal ways to find the value, using numerical reasoning or proportional reasoning. Later in the Unit, students will work more on solving the equations symbolically.)</li><li>How do you find how far you can walk in a given time?  Use the examples from What If Situation A for students to demonstrate their thinking.  (Note that this is informally solving for D when T is given. Students will have informal ways to find the values, using numerical reasoning or proportional reasoning. Later in the Unit, students will work more on solving the equations symbolically.)</li><li>How does the equation show the relationship between the two variables? (The equation shows that the distance is the product of the walkingrate and the time, or d = rt. The walking rate is the coefficient of the independent variable.) </li><li>Explain what information the numbers and variables in your equation represent. (Take this opportunity to see how students interpret the expression 2t. They should say something like “If my walking rate is 2 meters per second, this is the distance that I walked after t seconds.” Emphasize that 2t means 2 times the value of t.) </li><li>Which variable in your equation is the independent variable, and which is the dependent variable? (Time is the independent variable, and distance is the dependent variable.) </li></ul>",
