            "Students explore the walking rates of three students. They look at the walking rate and its effect on various representations of the relationship between distance and time. This Problem introduces ways to represent proportional linear relationships between two variables using tables, graphs, and equations. It is also the first time that students are asked to explain why a relationship is linear or to recognize a linear relationship from a table or an equation."
