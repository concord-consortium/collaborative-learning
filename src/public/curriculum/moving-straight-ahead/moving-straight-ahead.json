Omar uses intervals of 5 seconds and 10 meters, whereas Valentina uses intervals of 1 second and 1 meter. The different scales makes it appear that Valentina has a faster walking rate. However, their walking rates are the same. Because Omar’s vertical scale has twice the value as the horizontal scale, it appears to “pull down” the points as you have less vertical “movement” for every point. Valentina’s scales both have a value of one for every grid line. So, you will have the “same” movement on the horizontal and vertical axes for each coordinate pair."

Both of these relationships are also proportional, since at 0 seconds they have walked 0 meters.\n\n George’s, Evo’s, and Bob’s relationships are not linear. The table for George does not show a constant rate of change. Evo’s graph does not make a straight line, so it does not show a constant rate of change. In the equation for Bob, the rate is a variable, so the walking rate is not constant. (Some students may make graphs and claim the relationships are either linear or not based on whether the data lie on a straight line.)"

None of the movie theater problems are proportional situations, because none of them would pass through the origin if graphed.\nTables are useful for solving problems because they show several numerical values for a given pattern. Graphs are useful because they give you a sense of the pattern’s behavior over a wide range of values, which is helpful for estimating. Equations are useful because you can use them to calculate any specific value and the coefficients give you information about the problem situation. Inequalities are useful if you are looking for a range of possible answers."

Positive values of a give lines that slant up. Negative values of a give lines that slant down. The value of b gives the y-intercept of the line. It is represented as the point (0, b) on the line or the pair of values in a table. In a table, the y-intercept is the value where the x-value is 0, and the rate of change is the difference in consecutive values of the dependent variable for constant increments in the independent variable.\nAny ordered pair (point) that lies on the graph of a linear relationship can be used to find the solution to a problem. The ordered pair (x, y) represents specific values of the variables. If the value of one of the variables is known, then the graph can be traced to find the corresponding value of the other variable. Similarly, any ordered pair in a table for a linear relationship can be used to find the solution to a problem.\nTo find solutions to inequalities, we can consider the solution to the corresponding equality. Then consider the values that would make sense. Often the situation indicates the values to solve an inequality.

                          "If you have an equation of the form y = ax + b and you know the value of x or y, you can substitute the value of the variable into the equation. Then, use the properties of equality to solve for the other variable. For example, if y = 3x + 4 and you want to find x when y = 10, then you substitute 10 in place of y: 10 = 3x + 4. Next, you can subtract 4 from both sides to get 6 = 3x. Now, divide both sides by 3 to get x = 2.\nFor the equation y = 3x + 4, to find the value of x when y = 10, you can graph the equation. Trace along the line to find the point whose y-coordinate is 10 and then read the corresponding x-value, which is 2. To use a table, construct a table of values for the equation either by hand or with graphing technology. Next, locate the pair of values in which y = 10 and find the corresponding x-value, which is 2.\nTo find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 < 10, you can solve the corresponding equation 3x + 4 = 10. The solution of this equation is x = 2. Then, test values less than and greater than 2 to determine the solution. In this case, x-values less than 2 make the inequality 3x + 4 < 10 true, so the solution is x < 2.\nTo find the values that satisfy an inequality such as 3x + 4 < 10, you can graph the corresponding linear relationship y = 3x + 4. Then, find the points on the line whose y-values are less than 10. You can also locate the x-values of these points on the x-axis or on a number line.\nIn Problem 3.2, Equation 1 two equivalent expressions for the number of pouches on the left side of the equation are 4x + 2 and 2(2x + 1). You can use the properties of operations to show that they are equivalent. Applying the Distributive Property to one of the expressions yields the other: 4x + 2 = 2(2x + 1). You can also argue that both of the expressions represent the number of pouches and coins in the picture.\nIn Problem 3.3, Set 3(a), two equivalent ways of writing the expression on the left side of the equation are 3(x + 1) and 3x + 3. You can tell they are equivalent because the equations 3(x + 1) = 21 and 3x + 3 = 21 have the same solution, even though you would take different steps when solving them. (To solve the first equation, you would divide each side by 3 and then subtract 1 from each side. To solve the second equation, you would subtract 3 from each side and then divide each side by 3. The solution for both equations is x = 6.)"

                          "Slope describes the steepness of a line. It is the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change. If it is positive, then the line is increasing from left to right. If it is negative, then it is decreasing from left to right. If the slope is zero, the line is horizontal. This is like walking on a flat surface as opposed to up or down a hill.\nFinding the slope is the same as finding the rate of change between two variables in a linear relationship. The horizontal distance change between two points is the same as the difference between two corresponding x-values of points in a table. The vertical change in distance is the same as the difference between two corresponding y-values of points in a table."
