            "<ul><li>Start at the point where x is 3. What is the corresponding value for y? (5) </li><li>Now look at the point where x is -2. What is the corresponding value for y? (10) </li><li>What is the change in the horizontal and the vertical directions between these two points? How do you know? (In order to move from 3 to -2 on the x-axis, you move 5 units to the left. So the change in the horizontal direction is -5. In order to move from 5 to 10 on the y-axis, you move up 5 units. So the change in the vertical direction is 5.) </li><li>What does this tell you about the slope of the line representing the equation? (This tells you that the slope is 5/(-5) or -1.) </li><li>If you looked at the ratio of the horizontal change to the vertical change between two different points on the graph of the line, what would the ratio be? How do you know? (The line has the same steepness throughout the graph, so the ratio would still be -1.) </li><li>How do you find where these ideas are equal on a table/graph/equation?  (on a table it is when the same value exists for the y-value at the same x-value; on a graph it is the point of intersection; using an equation you can use properties of equality and solve for x)</li></ul>",
            "<p>Some students may use an income and expense expression and set them equal to each other to solve for x.  Some students may use a profit equation and subtract the income minus the expenses.</p>",

The Cost of T-Shirts problem? (Henri and Emile were 2 brothers in a walking race and we needed to find out when they were at the same point so we could determine how long the race should be; the Cost of T-Shirts was when we looked at 2 companies and decided when they were the same price so we could decide which company had the best prices.)</li></ul>"
