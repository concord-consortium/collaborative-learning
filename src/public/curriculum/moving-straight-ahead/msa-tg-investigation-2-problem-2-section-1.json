            "Students explore constant rate and y-intercept in a new context. They find solutions to equations. Students solve problems and make decisions about linear relationships and inequalities using information given in tables, graphs, and equations. This Problem formally introduces the words coefficient and solutions of an equation. The constant rate of change is emphasized as the coefficient of the independent variable. Students learn to recognize a linear relationship within a contextual situation, from an equation, table, or graph. "
