(Leanne) Who walks the slowest? (Alana) How can you tell? (Graph: Leanne’s line is the highest or steepest or has the largest angle from the x-axis. Alana’s line is the lowest or least steep or has the smallest angle from the x-axis. Table: For any number of seconds, other than zero seconds, Leanne has traveled the greatest distance and Alana has traveled the least distance. For example, at 5 seconds Leanne has walked 12.5 meters when Alana has only walked 5 seconds. Equation: The number multiplied by the time is the larger for Leanne who is faster and smaller for Alana who walks slower.)</li><li> If my walking rate was 2.3 meters per second, where would the line of my data be on the graph? (Between Leanne’s and Gilberto’s, because for every one second that you walk, you would travel 2.3 meters, 2 seconds would be 4.6 meters, etc.)</li><li> What is the equation for Alana? (d = 1t) Gilberto? (d = 2t) Leanne? (d = 2.5t) How did you find it? (Various answers. For example, to find the distance we multiply by the walking rate.)</li><li> If you increased your walking rate, what effect would that have on your table or graph? (If you increase the rate at which you walk, you can cover more distance in a given time. The distance in each row of the table would increase, and the graph would be steeper. Similarly, if you walk faster, it takes less time to cover a certain distance.)</li><li> As you change your walking rate to a faster rate, what effect does this have on the original equation? (The number multiplying [the coefficient] by the time t will increase.)</li><li>Which representation can I use to determine the distance I walk in 15 seconds? The time it takes to walk 20 meters?  (Answers will vary.)</li></ul>"

For Billie, for every 1 second, the distance increases by 2.25 meters. The equation is in the form d = rt, so the walking rate is the same as the value of r. For George, distance increases with time, but there does not seem to be a pattern. For Bob, as rate increases, time decreases.) </li><li> Describe what is happening in each situation. (According to the table, George is not walking at a constant rate. Elizabeth is walking at a constant rate and is using an interval of 2 seconds. If Evo’s represents time and distance, she walked at a consistent rate, stopped for some time, then walked again at a consistent rate. Billie is also walking at a constant rate because the equation is similar to those for Alana, Gilberto, and Leanne. Bob is walking 100 meters, but the rate and time are not known. His walking rate may or may not be constant because the variables are time and rate, not time and distance.) </li><li> After 5 seconds, who is ahead? (According to the table, George walks 25 meters in 5 seconds. In that time, Elizabeth walks 7.5 meters, and Billie walks 11.25 meters.

Therefore, if the graph is not a straight line, the relationship it models is not linear.) </li><li> How can you tell if a table does not represent a linear relationship?
