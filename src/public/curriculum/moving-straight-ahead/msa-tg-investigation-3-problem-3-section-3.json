Multiplication is used on 5 and x.) </li><li>Look at the equation. What is a good starting step? (Answers will vary. Some students may divide each side of the equation by 5. Others may add or subtract 10 or 5x to each side.) </li><li>How can you get rid of, or “undo,” each operation, but still maintain equality? (You can use the opposite, or inverse, operation. To “undo” subtraction, you add.) </li></ul>"
