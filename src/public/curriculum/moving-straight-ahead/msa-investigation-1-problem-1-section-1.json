            "<p>This Problem introduces patterns of change between two variables in the context of a walkathon. Students determine their walking rates in meters per second as a ratio of distance to time. This Problem connects back to the rate work done in Comparing and Scaling while laying the foundation for using rate to look at patterns of change. Students answer questions about time and distance using their constant walking rates and write an equation that models the distance walked over time at their constant walking rates.</p>"
