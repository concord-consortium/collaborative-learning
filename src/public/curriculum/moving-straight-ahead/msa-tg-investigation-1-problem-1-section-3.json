For groups that do not know how to begin, you can ask them questions to help them decide how to conduct the experiment.\n\n<strong>Suggested Questions</strong><ul><li> What are the variables that we need to collect data on? (meters and seconds)</li><li> How can we measure those? (meters using a meter stick and seconds with a timer)</li><li> So, if someone is walking, what do we need to measure to find the walking rate? (the distance in meters and the time that it takes to walk that distance)</li><li> How long would you need to walk for someone to get an idea of how fast or slow you walk? (Answers will vary, but students might say a general distance such as walking down the hallway.)</li><li> What is a convenient distance to use? (Answers will vary. You may want to push for a distance like 10 meters.)</li></ul>"
