            "<p>In this Problem, students explore a symbolic method for finding the point of intersection of two lines. Students connect this method to other methods of finding the point of intersection, such as using a graph or table of data that represents each relationship.</p>",
            "<p>Students find the point of intersection of two lines by setting the expressions for <em>y</em> equal to each other and then solving for <em>x</em>. They use the <em>x</em>-value to find the <em>y</em>-value for the coordinates of the intersection point. If the two relationships are represented by <em>y</em><sub><em>1</em></sub><em> = mx + b</em> and <em>y</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em> = kx + c</em>, then the point of intersection of the lines representing each equation occurs when <em>y</em><sub><em>1</em></sub><sub> </sub>= <em>y</em><sub><em>2</em></sub>, or<em> mx + b = kx + c</em>.</p>",
            "<p>Students find the values of x that satisfy the inequalities <em>y</em><sub><em>1</em></sub> &lt;<em>y</em><sub><em>2</em></sub> and <em>y</em><sub><em>1</em></sub> &gt; <em>y</em><sub><em>2</em></sub>. They also write and interpret equivalent expressions and solve inequalities using graphs and equations.</p>",
            "<p>Note that by finding the point of intersection of two lines they are also  solving a system of two linear equations which is studied more formally in the 8th grade unit, Itâ€™s in the System.</p>"
