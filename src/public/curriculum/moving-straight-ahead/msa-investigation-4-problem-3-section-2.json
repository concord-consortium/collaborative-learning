Students may mention walking rates, money raised for charity during a walkathon, the income and expenses of Fabulous Fabian’s Bakery, etc.) </li><li>Are there any clues in the situation that might help us determine that it is linear? If so, what clues indicate the rate of change or <em>y</em>‐intercept? (Again, answers will vary, but students should mention that the constant rate of change [walking rate in meters per second, money raised in dollars per kilometer, income earned in dollars per cake sold, etc.] tells you the slope. They should also be able to say that the y‐intercept is the value of the independent variable at the beginning of the situation (a head start of 40 meters in a walking race, a donor who pledges $5 even if you walk 0 kilometers, an income of $0 for selling 0 cakes, etc.).)  </li></ul>",
