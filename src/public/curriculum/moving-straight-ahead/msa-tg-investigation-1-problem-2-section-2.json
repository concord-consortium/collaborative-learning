The introduction to this Problem offers a chance to revisit the vocabulary while also introducing “equivalent expressions” and “rate of change.” Both expressions and equations have variables, only equations show equality.  Expressions can implicitly imply another variable(s).  Teaching Aid 1.2: Walking Rate can provide an example for the conversation."

We used 50 mph, 55 mph, and 60 mph rates to examine the patterns between distance and time in tables, graphs, and equations.)</li><li> If we looked at your data on a graph, how could you describe the pattern of change for your walking rate? (Possible answer with a walking rate of 1.5: For every 1 second that I walked, I traveled 1.5 meters.)</li><li> Here is an example [show Teaching Aid 1.2 or an example of a student’s data] of a table and graph for someone who walked 1.5 meters per second. What do you notice about the data on the graph? (The data lines up because the pattern is consistent.)</li><li> How does this show up in the table? (Every increase of 1 second adds 1.5 meters to the distance.)</li><li> Because this pattern of change describes how your data consistently increases over time, we call this the rate of change. What was your rate of change in your walking experiment? (Possible answer with a walking rate of 1.5 meters per second: 1.5.)</li></ul>"

Possible answer includes: If you increase the rate at which you walk, you can cover more distance in a given time. The distance in the table would increase for each second walked, and the graph would be steeper. Similarly, if you walk faster, it takes less time to cover a certain distance. The equation would have a larger number that multiplies by the variable.)</li></ul>"
