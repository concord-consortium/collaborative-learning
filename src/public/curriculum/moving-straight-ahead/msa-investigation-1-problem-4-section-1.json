In the last Problem, the graph representing Alana’s pledge plan crossed the y-axis at point at (0, 5). Leanne’s crosses the y-axis at point at (0, 10). Gilberto’s pledge plan crossed the y-axis at (0, 0). These points are called the y-intercepts. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, or when x = 0. </p>"
