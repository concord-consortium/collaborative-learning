That is, for every unit change in the independent variable, the dependent variable decreases by a constant positive amount (which is equivalent to saying the dependent variable increases by a constant negative amount).</p>",
            "<p>One situation uses a graphical representation, and the other uses a tabular representation. Students interpret and compare information from different representations and build on skills recognizing linear relationships from various representations. The y-intercept is named and students begin to interpret it as a point on a line, an entry in a table, or as the constant b in the equation y = ax + b.</p>"
