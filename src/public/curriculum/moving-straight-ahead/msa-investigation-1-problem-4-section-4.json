Or answers may be specific, such as Ms. Chang’s class uses more money a week than Mr. Mamer’s.)</li><li>What do you notice about the amount in the accounts for the two classes? (Students will have various answers that can guide how you proceed with asking other questions in the Summary.)</li></ul>",

            "<ul><li>What If Situation A asks about the amount of money at 10 weeks. We know the value of the x-variable (independent variable). How do we find the value of the other variable? (Various answers using the table, graph, and/or equations.) The basic idea is to see if given the value of x, students can find y.</li><li>What If Situation A asks about when the money is spent. Where would we see this in the table? (When the amount of money [y-variable or independent variable] is zero.) Where would we see this on the graph? (When the amount of money is zero, the line would hit the x-axis.) You could introduce the vocabulary of x-intercept at this time. But it is not necessary for all students to learn at this time.</li><li>In What if Situation B, what questions might the student have about the accounts? (In the equation, we know that the amount of money is $100. So the question asked would be: At what time does the account have $100? With the inequality, the question would be: When does the account have less than $100.) The basic idea is to see if given the value of y, can students make sense of finding x.</li></ul>"

For both classes, it isthe constant rate of change or the difference in the amount of money between two consecutive weeks.)</li><li>Compare the rates of change in this Problem with other rates that we have studied in this Unit. How do the rates in this Problem show up in a table? In a graph? In an equation? (These rates are negative, and the previous rates were positive [or zero]. These tables show a constant decrease in the dependent variable as the independent variable increases. The graphs show lines that decrease from left to right, which is the opposite of the previous rates we studied. The coefficient of the independent variable in these equations is negative, while it was positive in previous Problems.]</li><li>What are the y-intercepts? Chang: (0, 144) and Mamer: (0, 500)</li><li>What do they tell you about the money in each class’s account? (How much money is in the account at the start.)</li><li>What is the pattern of change for the relationship between the variables? (Chang: The amount in the account decreases by $12 each week. Mamer: The amount in the account decreases by $50 every 5 weeks or by $10 each week.)</li><li>How do we see the pattern of change in the table? (Chang: As the weeks increase by 1, the amount of money in the account subtracts $12. Mamer: As the weeks increase by 5, the amount of money in the account subtracts $50. Or, thinking proportionally, as the weeks increase by 1, the amount of money in the account subtracts $10.)</li></ul>"
