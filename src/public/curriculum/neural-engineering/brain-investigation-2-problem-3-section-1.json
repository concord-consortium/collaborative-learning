            "<p>In the last two lessons we explored the significant role of the nervous system in processing sensory information, as well as the impact of refined sensory information on movement. In this activity we will explore how a simple model of a bionic arm can be designed so that pressure can be sensed. In this activity, you will be presented with the following challenge:</p>",
