            "<p>In this lesson, you will learn about electrical signals in the human body, measure your reaction time, and develop a model to explain how body systems interact during limb movement. This will help you understand how bionic arms work (like the ones used by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2MjTcmLuIQ&amp;t=1s'>Tilly</a>). </p>",
            "<p><strong>Learning Objective</strong></p>",
            "<p>By the end of this activity, you will be able to explain what body systems are involved in limb movement and how they interact with one another. </p>",

            "<p>Working with your classmates, explore the behavior of energy sticks. You may try the following: </p>",
            "<p>1) Have one person touch both ends of the energy sticks.</p>",
            "<p>2) Have two people touch the energy stick while holding hands. </p>",
            "<p>3) Get a group of students to hold hands in a circle. Put the energy stick between two of the students. Does it turn on?</p>",
            "<p>4) Give one pair of students something to hold between them (e.g.,  a metal key or a pencil). Do these objects conduct or insulate?</p>"
