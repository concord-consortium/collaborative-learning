            "<p>The nervous system guides almost everything you do. It controls complex functions, such as movement, thought, and memory, as well as vital functions, such as breathing. The nervous system is made of billions of specialized cells called neurons. Neurons use electrical signals to communicate with one another. Different kinds of neurons send different signals. Motor neurons make your muscles move, whereas sensory neurons pick up information from the environment (sight, sound, touch etc.) and send signals to your brain. </p>",
            "<p>The nervous system has two main parts</p>",
            "<p><strong>Central nervous system</strong>: Consists of the brain and spinal cord. </p>",
            "<p><strong>Peripheral nervous system</strong>: Consists of nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal cord all over your body. </p>",
            "<p>Annotate the parts of the nervous system in the following image by adding a text tile to your workspace and indicating what part of the nervous system is marked by each number.  Then, think about how each part of the nervous system might be involved in controlling limb movement. Note: you can also drag images into drawing tiles so you can write on top of them.</p>"
