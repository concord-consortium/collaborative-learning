            "<p><strong>Does reaction time depend on tactile feedback?</strong></p>",
            "<p>As you recall, in lesson 1.2, you measured your reaction time using a ruler, comparing your dominant and non-dominant hand. Today we will conduct a similar experiment to investigate how tactile information impacts reaction time (in other words, how being able to feel the ruler with our fingertips impacts how fast we are at catching it?).  </p>",
            "<p>If you need a reminder on how to conduct the experiment, please watch this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJEuT3aKcMI'>video</a>.</p>",
            "<p>Follow these steps:</p>",
            "<p>1. Decide who is the Dropper and who is the Catcher.</p>",
            "<p>2. The catcher should extend their hand with the index finger and thumb about 1 cm apart. The dropper should hold the ruler at the top such that the catcher has their thumb and index fingers on either side of the zero cm mark.</p>",
            "<p>3. When the catcher says they are ready. the dropper should count up, in their head, to a number between 3 and 5 (use a different number each time). When the number is reached, they drop the ruler.</p>",
            "<p>4. Catcher catches the ruler as fast as they can. Ignore any times the ruler falls on the ground. </p>",
            "<p>5. Enter the ruler cm value closest to Catcherâ€™s pinch point in the table below (you should first drag the table to your worksheet). </p>",
            "<p>6. Repeat steps 2-5 five times.</p>",
            "<p>7. Repeat the process <u>while the catcher is wearing a winter glove</u>. </p>",
            "<p></p>",
