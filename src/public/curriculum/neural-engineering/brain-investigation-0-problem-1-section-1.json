When you start an activity, CLUE drops you into a group randomly. <strong>You can change groups by clicking on the group number in the upper right corner.</strong> Then, you can either join an existing group that has fewer than four students, or start a new group. Your teacher may ask you to join a specific group. When you change groups, your work moves with you.</p>",
