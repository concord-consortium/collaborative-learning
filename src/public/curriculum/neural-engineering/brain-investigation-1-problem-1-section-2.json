            "<p><strong>Meet Tilly</strong></p>",
            "<p>Tilly is a real-life bionic teen.  At only 15 months old, Tilly had both her hands amputated at the wrist because of a very rare infection. For years she used basic silicon arms, but in 2018 she became the first child in the UK to have bionic arms. These high-tech, 3D printed arms give Tilly a much fuller range of movement. In class, you will watch a video about Tilly,  who is now a model, public speaker and make-up vlogger. In the video, Tilly showcases her colorful arm cases, before applying a full face of make-up - and trying out a new edgy look. </p>",
