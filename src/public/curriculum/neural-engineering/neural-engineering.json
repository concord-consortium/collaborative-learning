Mrs. Marcus is enjoying her retirement, with ample time to bake for her nine grandchildren and maintain her flower garden with her husband of 60 years. </p>",

Hypoesthesia is reduced or complete loss of sensation. In Mrs. Marcus’s case, Dr. Romero believes that inflammation of joints in Mrs. Marcus’s hands are pressing against the surrounding nerves, resulting in numbness. This is unsafe, especially given Mrs. Marcus is unable to sense temperature and touch in her fingers when she bakes.</p>"
