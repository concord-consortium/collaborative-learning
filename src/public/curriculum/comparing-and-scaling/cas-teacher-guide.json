It depends on what quantity you want to compare. It is important that when comparing, you choose the same type of ratio (part to part or part to whole) and choose the same quantity, e.g., concentrate, water, or total cups, to scale to 1.)</li><li>Is there any other unit rate that a student could have written? (Yes. Dan scaled the concentrate to 1. He could have scaled the total cups to 1. He would have the unit rate of 2/5 cups of concentrate for every 1 cup of juice.)</li><li>How are unit rates different from percentages? (Unit rates can be found from part to part or part to whole ratios. Percentages always have to be part to whole comparisons.)</li><li>How are unit rates like percentages? (In each case, one of the quantities is scaled up or down to 1 (for a unit rate) or 100 (for a percentage), making it easy to do a comparison between ratios. This makes it easy to do a comparison between ratios.)</li></ul>"

Finding equivalent fractions and scaling ratios seems a lot the same. Different: Fractions are numbers and ratios are a comparison of two numbers. Fractions are always part to whole relationships of a quantity while ratios can be part to part or part to whole comparisons of two quantities. When we find equivalent fractions, we find different names for the same amount. When we find equivalent ratios, the amount may change but the relationship between the amounts stays the same.)</li></ul>"
