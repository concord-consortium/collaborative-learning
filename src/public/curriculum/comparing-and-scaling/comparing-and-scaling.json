In other cases, more complex reasoning is required. All of the questions in <em>Looking Ahead</em> involve comparisons. In the <em>Comparing Quantities</em> Unit, you explored many ways to compare numbers and to analyze comparisons that involved ratios. You continued your exploration of ratios in the <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> Unit with similar figures or scale drawings. In this Unit you will deepen your understanding of proportional relationships, including ways to represent and use comparison strategies for solving problems and making decisions. "

For the sales tax, you might see percents such as 5%, 6.2%, or 8%. These are the rates by which the sales price is increased.
