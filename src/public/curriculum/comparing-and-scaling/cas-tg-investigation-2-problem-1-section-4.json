Possible reasoning may include: 25 is about 3 times 8, so there could be 3 x 3 or 9 pizzas at an extra-large table. Or 25 is 2.5 times 10, so there could be 2.5 x 4 or 10 pizzas at an extra-large table. Or somewhere between 3/8 and 4/10 of a pizza per person. Or just use the amount on the large table because that had the most pizza for each person.)</li><li>What strategies did you use to find the number of pizzas? (Answers will vary.
