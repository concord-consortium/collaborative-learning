(Yes; this is the Distributive Property in action.)</li><li>You found it pretty easy to find 10%, 20%, and 15% in Situation A. Why is this? Does your shortcut work for other percents like 22% or 7%? (It is easy to scale from 100 to 10 by moving the decimal one place value. 20 is a multiple of 10 and 5 is a factor of 10, so those can be easily scaled. Since 22 and 7 are not multiples or factors of 10, so in those cases, we would probably want to start by scaling from 100% to 1%. 22 and 7 are multiples of 1.)</li></ul>"
