            "<p>In the <em>Comparing Quantities</em> unit, we looked at many situations that involved ratios. Recall that a ratio is a comparison between two quantities. We looked at many comparison situations such as Packaging Green and White Cupcakes, Walking Backwards Race, and Sharing Smoothie Bars. </p>",

            "<p>            For every 2 green cupcakes there are 3 white cupcakes, or</p>",

            "<p>In the <em>Stretching and Shrinking</em> unit, we also wrote the ratio 2 to 3 as â…”. This is called the fraction form of a ratio. </em></p>",
            "<p>     <em>How is this fraction form of a ratio the same as or different from fractions?</em></p>",
            "<p>We also know that two ratios are equivalent if they express the same comparisons. For example, the ratio of green cupcakes to white cupcakes is the same in the following packages: </p>",
