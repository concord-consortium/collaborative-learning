Students are likely to answer that all are part to part. The Smoothie Bar scenario could be either. In the Reading Speed scenario, it does not make sense to find a whole because it is a rate. Height of Trees are two similar figures, and students will probably keep the parts of height and base. With Student Council Representation students are likely to discuss part-to-whole.)</li><li>What are some strategies that you have heard for finding two equivalent ratios? (Answers might include: scaling ratios, drawing pictures, using scale factors, ratio tables, unit rate, and proportions.)</li><li>For What If Situation A, what strategies are you using to solve for x? (Answers will vary. Students may use strategies like those mentioned above.)</li><li>For Situation B, what would a proportion look like for that situation?  (Answers will vary.)</li></ul>"
