            "<p>We have seen proportional situations in Royal’s Pizza, Sharing Pizzas at the Tables, the Orange Juice Recipes, and with similar figures.</p>",
            "<p>A proportional situation is multiplicative. It involves using factors or multiples of the quantities in a ratio.</p>",
            "<p>With proportional situations, we can:</p>",
            "<ul><li>Scale ratios by multiplying or dividing both quantities to find equivalent ratios.</li><li>Show the equivalent ratios in many ways including tables and proportions.</li><li>Use the unit rate to write equations, like Mary did for Royal’s, CR = 13n.</li><li>Make graphs that go through the origin.</li></ul>"
