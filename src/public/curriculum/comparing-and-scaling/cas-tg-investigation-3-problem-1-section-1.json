            "<p>This Problem builds on students’ understandings of percent that begin in the Grade 6 Comparing Quantities Unit. A percent is a part to whole comparison of two quantities where the whole of one of the quantities is 100. This Problem explores the use of percent proportional relationships to solve problems about tax.</p>",

            "<p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>: Be sure to hold a discussion after the Initial Challenge before moving on to the What If. This will allow you to highlight your students’ strategies before analyzing the strategies of other students that are presented in the What If. You can use the strategies in the What If to connect to how your students thought about the proportional reasoning in the tax situation. If students aren’t interested in the context of buying school supplies in the Initial Challenge you could use items from a local store’s weekly sales advertisement.</p>",

            "<p>Have students work on the Initial Challenge. As a class, discuss the strategies and solutions for the determining the total cost with tax. After the discussion, have students work on the What If questions. For Situation A, you might have students think about and discuss as a class the strategies not already presented by your students. This may allow a discussion of strategies different from students’ own thinking for solving the Initial Challenge. Situation C offers an opportunity to work backward to find the cost of an item when we know the tax amount.</p>"
