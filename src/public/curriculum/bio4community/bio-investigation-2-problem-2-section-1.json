            "<p><strong>Estrella</strong>: Yeah… I was wondering if you could explain to me some science about attention and stress? </p>",
            "<p><strong>Ms. Guerra</strong>: Oh of course. Your brain is a really complicated organ and spends your whole life processing so much information. When we feel stressed it can get harder for us to focus on things. </p>",
            "<p><strong>Estrella</strong>: That makes sense…. </p>",
            "<p><strong>Ms. Guerra</strong>: Remember earlier in the year we talked about neurons. </p>",
            "<p><strong>Estrella</strong>: I think so. Aren&#x27;t neurons the cells in your brain that send signals to each other? </p>",
            "<p><strong>Ms. Guerra</strong>: Yes!  If your issue is being able to focus, you need to work on growing more connections between the neurons in your brain! </p>"
