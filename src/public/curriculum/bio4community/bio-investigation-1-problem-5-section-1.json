He knew this was not good news, but he had no idea what to do about it. His thoughts raced and he started to feel dizzy. He closed his eyes and took several deep breaths to calm his body down. He thought about what he could do right now and decided to email the scientist in that video about saliva cortisol tests. Her name was Dr. Zeiders and her email was on the website. Rakesh emailed Dr. Zeiders: </p>"
