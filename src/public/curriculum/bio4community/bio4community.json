They always knew how to make him smile. He wanted to give them a stable life so he worked 15-hour days and woke up early to make his kids breakfast before going to work. It was hard being a single dad. </p>",

That left little time for Rakesh (Rah-kay-sh) to destress and have “me” time. But it was worth it if it meant he could eventually be promoted to manager. A higher pay and more stable hours would mean more time with his kids. As he looked at the note, Rakesh remembered the conversation he had with his kids that morning. </p>"

Moving out of his parents’ home and into an apartment with Josué was so exciting, it was a dream come true even though all they could afford was a tiny basement apartment that was old and pretty run down. At the same time, law school life also meant that he had to pay for his college fees, course textbooks, and of course, rent and groceries! Moving away from home, living with his boyfriend, and starting this new phase in his life meant he had new responsibilities and more expenses. </p>",
