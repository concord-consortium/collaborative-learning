It was hard being a single dad. Even though his kids were older and in 7th grade and high school, it still felt like all the world’s burdens were on his shoulders; but seeing them happy helped. He wanted to give his kids a stable life so he worked 10 hours a night and woke up early to make his kids breakfast before going to work.</p>",

Being an immigrant without a degree posed difficulties finding a job so he needed to find places willing to hire him. Amazon offered that to him and is one of the few places that is close enough to where he lives and provides opportunities for him to get paid more. So while Amazon may not be his dream job, he found that his dreams changed to making sure his kids had a stable life and could one day afford a higher education.

This often meant that they were at work for long hours and so Estrella’s abuela stayed home and watched over her and her 3 younger siblings. Abuela did a lot for them but sometimes it got hard to take care of so many things, so Estrella took it upon herself to help out around the house. She loved doing it because on top of getting to help her Abuela, it also meant that sometimes she got to be in charge of her siblings. </p>",
                                  "<p>Her younger brothers and sister could be so annoying sometimes and yet so cute at the same time. She often picked them up from their elementary school and they would tell her everything that happened during their day with bright eyes and wide smiles which warmed Estrella’s heart. Once they got home she walked their family dog, and then spent the afternoon making sure her siblings did their homework and daily chores before dinner. Their family tried to eat together every evening and Abuela’s cooking was the best. By the time Estrella finished eating dinner and doing the dishes, it was usually already 7pm. She would then often chat or play video games with her friends for a while. She loved hanging out with her two best friends. Needless to say, this meant Estrella stayed up until midnight most days to get her work done. Sometimes she was so tired she wished she could just go to sleep but her grades were important to her and she was doing well in school. </p>",

She really did want to focus in class, but sometimes the teacher’s voice became nothing but white noise and Estrella would zone out. She tried to make up for it by working hard on her homework, but homework alone does not prepare someone for tests. She needed to be able to pay attention in class if she wanted to keep her grades up. </p>"
