There are also content tabs on the left that hold curriculum, help and documentation, and reusable content from your own library or your class or your instructor. /br /br There are also subsections in many tabs. For example, in this help section you will see subsections for :<ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Tools</li><li>Sharing</li><li>Instructors</li></ul>"
