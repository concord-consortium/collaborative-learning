            "CLUE is an educational environment that allows you to create and share live content with your peers so you can solve problems together. When you launch an activity, you'll see a work area on the right. This is where you can create text, graphs, images, drawings and other STEM content. There are also content tabs on the left that hold curriculum, help and documentation, and reusable content from your own library or your class or your instructor. \n\nThere are also subsections in many tabs. For example, in this help section you will see subsections for :<ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Tools</li><li>Sharing</li><li>Instructors</li></ul>"
