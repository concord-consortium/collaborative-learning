Meals served per year were estimated as a function of enrollment, dependent also on whether a school is classified as a residential or non-residential institution. Seven residential institutions provided data that generated a mean estimate of 1.5 meals served per  student per day (range: 0.66 meals/student-day - 2.98 meals/student-day; median = 1.38 meals/student-day).  Assuming that food service operates 270 days a year, this generates an estimate of 405 meals served per enrolled student per year for residential institutions. Five non-residential institutions provided data with a mean value of approximately 0.4 meals/student-day (range: 0.17 meals/student-day - 0.96 meals/student-day; median = 0.29 meals/student-day).
