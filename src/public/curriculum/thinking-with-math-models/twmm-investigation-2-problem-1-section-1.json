            "*A **zip line** is a cable that starts at a higher point than it ends. Using the natural decline of the cable, a person or cargo can travel down the wire on a pulley system that minimizes friction to help the rider accelerate.  For example, for a 200′ **zip line** that is 7′ high in the middle (when loaded with a rider), **should** sag 5% or 10 feet. This means that the end attachments are 17′ high each. At this point, plan that the longer the **zip line**, the higher in the air you'll need to be to start.*",
