            "In any problem that calls for a linear mode that is an equation, the goal is to find the values of *m* and *b* for the linear equation y = *m*x + *b* that fits the data pattern well. Recall from *Moving Straight Ahead* unit that for linear relationships as x increases by a fixed increment y changes by a constant amount, *m*, called the rate of change. The y-intercept is (0,*b*) or *b*. "
