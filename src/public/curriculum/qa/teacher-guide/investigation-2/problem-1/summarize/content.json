            "<ul><li>Which characters are imposters? How do you know? (Glug and Lug. Flesh out how you know they are imposters by looking at side lengths, perimeters, areas, and angles as described in the following questions.)</li><li>In earlier Units in CMP, we learned that both the angles and the lengths of edges help determine the shape of the figure. How do the corresponding angles of the five figures compare? (Display the figures and compare corresponding angles. This reinforces that when you measure angles, you measure the amount of turn between the edges and not the lengths of the edges. In Mug, Zug, and Bug, the corresponding angles are equal. In Mug and Lug (or Glug), the corresponding angles (except the right angles) are not equal.)</li><li>Are the lengths related? Are some of them related and others not? How do the lengths in similar Wumps compare? (Compare some of the lengths to show that in Mug, Bug, and Zug, the corresponding lengths grow the same way. They are multiplied by the same number. Students will begin to notice that if the coefficients of both the x- and y-coordinates of the rule are the same, the figure is similar to the original. If the coefficients are different, the figure will change more in one direction than the other and will be distorted. One special case that you should help students notice is the case where we multiply the x and y by 1 to get a new figure. In this case the figures are similar. Even more, they are congruent. You get a figure of exactly the same size and shape. This case will occur in Problem 2.2.)</li><li>Are the perimeters related? Are some of them related and others not? How do the perimeters in similar Wumps compare? (Compare some of the perimeters – for example, the mouth or legs or one other part – to show that with Mug, Bug, and Zug, the corresponding perimeters grow the same way. They are multiplied by the same number. Students will begin to notice that if the coefficients of both the x- and y-coordinates of the rule are the same, the figure is similar to the original. If the coefficients are different, the figure will change more in one direction than the other and will be distorted. One special case that you should help students notice is the case where we multiply the x and y by 1 to get a new figure. In this case the figures are similar. Even more, they are congruent. You get a figure of exactly the same size and shape. This case will occur in Problem 2.2.)</li><li>Could you use ratios or “for every” statements to describe the characters that are similar to Mug? (Yes. For example, Bug is Similar to Mug. For every side length on Mug the corresponding side length on Bug is three times as long.  The ratio to represent a side length on Mug and its corresponding side length on Bug is 1:3.)</li><li>For What If Situation A, which claims are correct? Why? (Marta, Jacob, and Billie are correct. Students should be able to talk about how the numbers in front of x and y (coefficients) must be the same so that all the side lengths increase by the same multiplier. Students should also recognize that the angles stayed the same in the Wump family members.)</li><li>What are some rules you could use to create a figure similar to Lug in What If Situation B?  (Answers will vary but the rule should have x and y multiplied by the same number.  Students may not have mastered using the rules at this point. They will have time to develop this further in the rest of this Investigation.)</li></ul>"
