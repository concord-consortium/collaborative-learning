            "The Mystery Club at P.I. Middle School meets monthly. Members watch videos, discuss novels, play “whodunit” games, and talk about real-life mysteries. One day, a member announces that the school is having a contest. A teacher in disguise will appear for a few minutes at school each day for a week. Any student can pay $1 for a guess at the identity of the mystery teacher. The student with the first correct guess wins a prize."
