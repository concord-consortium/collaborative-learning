            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p>",
            "<p>This Problem challenges students to find ways of putting multiple copies of a figure together to make a larger, similar figure. This process is called rep‑tiling. Rep‑tiling allows students to revisit similarity in a new context. In deciding how to put rep‑tiles together, students identify relationships between the scale factor, side lengths, and areas of similar figures. For example, they find that if the scale factor from a smaller quadrilateral to a larger quadrilateral is 2, the side lengths and perimeter grow by a factor of 2. The area, however, grows by a factor of 22, or 4.</p>"

Having a conversation after students have completed the Initial Challenge can help them focus their thinking between the two class periods. </p>"
