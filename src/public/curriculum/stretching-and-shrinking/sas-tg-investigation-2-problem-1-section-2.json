The winner is the person who gets four in a row first (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The players take turns telling you two numbers that designate the location of the intersection point for their X or their O. This is different from the traditional game where the X’s and O’s are placed in the middle of each square. With little instruction, nearly every student will recall how to graph points in a hurry.
