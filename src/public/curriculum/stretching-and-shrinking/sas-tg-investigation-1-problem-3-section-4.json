Students will often use additive descriptions first such as, ”For 150% you just take the original and added on half as much.”  Guide them to refine their thinking and use multiplicative structures to see that the side lengths are 1.5 times longer.)</li><li>To help students think about these ideas with a multiplicative structure versus additive you could ask them if there is a way to use a “for every” statement to express their idea.  (“For every length on the original the corresponding length on the image is 1.5 times as long”.)</li><li>If I want to enlarge a figure by 25% will the image be larger or smaller than the original? What number do I enter in the photocopier? (To increase a figure by 25% you multiply the figure by a factor of 1.25. So, you enter 125% into the photocopier.)  Explain why this is true.</li> <li>If we want to make a copy of the original drawing that does NOT change the size, what percent would we use?(100%)</li><li>How do the corresponding angles of the Super Sleuth’s characters compare?  (Corresponding angles are all the same angle measure) </li></ul>"
