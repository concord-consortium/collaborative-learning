            "<p>In this Problem students learn how to make similar and non-similar shapes using a coordinate system. Students graph members of the Wump family, plus other figures that claim to be in the Wump family. Students will notice that members of the Wump family are similar to one another (Zug and Bug are both similar to Mug). The imposters (Glug and Lug) are not similarâ€”one is distorted vertically and one is distorted horizontally. Corresponding angles are not congruent, and corresponding side lengths are not multiplied by the same factor. Students compare the shapes, side lengths, and angles of the figures they draw as they contrast similar figures with non-similar ones.</p>"
