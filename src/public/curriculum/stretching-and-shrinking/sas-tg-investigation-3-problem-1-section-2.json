This Problem continues students’ exploration of scale factors and similarity by rep-tiling, or building shapes from copies of smaller, similar shapes with a focus on the area change.</p>",
            "<p>In each of these contexts, students study how the areas of two similar figures are related to the scale factor. It is often surprising to students that if they apply a scale factor of 2 to a figure (or in general, n), the area becomes four times as great (in general, n2 as great).</p>",
            "<p>At this stage, students should not be concerned with area calculations. Instead, students use rep-tiles to see that when they apply a scale factor of 2, it requires four copies of the original figure. In this case, students measure area using the original figure as the unit rather than units of square inches or square centimeters.</p>"
