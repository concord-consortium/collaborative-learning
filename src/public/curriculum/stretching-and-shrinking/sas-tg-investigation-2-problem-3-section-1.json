            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p>",
            "<p>Students continue to work with the Wump family as they investigate side lengths, angles, perimeters, and areas of similar rectangles and triangles. Students use the idea of same shape to discover that scaled drawings/similar figures have corresponding angles that have the same measure and that corresponding sides grow or shrink by the same factor. Proportional reasoning is the ability to make comparisons between objects using multiplicative thinking instead of additive thinking.</p>",
            "<p></p>",
            "<p>The vocabulary of <strong>scale factor</strong> is introduced. As students analyze the diagram of noses and mouths from the Wump family, they will notice that scale factor only applies to these scaled drawings or similar figures. Scale factor does not apply to non-similar figures, as pairs of corresponding sides do not grow or shrink by the same factor. This problem will help solidify for students how using a scale factor is applying their proportional reasoning. </p>"
