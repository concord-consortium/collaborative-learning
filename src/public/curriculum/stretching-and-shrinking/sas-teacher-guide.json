Mystery Club enters a contest to guess the identity of a teacher in disguise.

Scaled drawings and the concept of similarity are used to set the backdrop for the students’ work in 7th grade on proportional reasoning. The words scaled drawings and similarity can be used interchangeably at this point for students. Students’ understanding will develop throughout the Unit and is revisited in each of the Mathematical Reflections. Students will take this understanding into 8th grade where they will study similarity more formally as they study what happens to congruent and similar figures under transformations in the Flip, Spin, Slide, and Stretch Unit.</p>"

They may use this and write a multiplication sentence: 7 x 10 = 70 inches tall  or they might use a ratio of 1:7 and then scale up each ratio by 10.</li><li>In the picture, the height of the P. I. Monthly is 0.5 in. We know that the height of the real magazine is 10 in. So, the real magazine is 10 ÷ 0.5 = 2 times larger than in the picture. The teacher should also be 20 times larger in real life than he/she is in the picture. The teacher’s height in the picture is about  3 5/8 in. So, the actual height is about 20 x (3 5/8) =72  in. </li><li>Students may use ratio or “for every” statements, such as “The ratio of the teacher’s height in the picture to her height in real life is about 1 to 20.” or “For every inch in height of the magazine in the picture, there are 20 inches in height for the real magazine.”</li><li>Students may also compare the magazine in the picture to the teacher in the picture. In this case, the teacher is 3 5/8  ÷  1/2 = 7 1/4  times as tall as the magazine. Students may say that the teacher is  7 1/4 magazines tall. This should be true in real life as well. Since the height of the magazine is 10 in., the teacher is  10 x 7 1/4 = 72.5 in. tall.</li><li>Some students will measure the height of both the magazine and of the mystery teacher in inches. They will then divide the height of the teacher by the height of the magazine to find how many magazines tall the teacher is. This is a more precise version of the first strategy. Make sure students are clear about the comparisons that they are making. They may compare the real magazine to the magazine in the picture or the magazine in the picture to the teacher in the picture.</li><li>If a video projector, electronic whiteboard, or document camera is available in the classroom, students might suggest projecting the image at full scale, zooming in or out until the P.I. Monthly magazine’s height is about 10 inches on the screen. This would also work if the magazine could be projected at 50% of full scale, so that its height is 5 inches on the screen.</li></ul>"

Possible answers: You might want to use a photograph to estimate the size of a large item you plan to buy, such as a large bookshelf. Estimating its size can help you determine whether or not it will fit in its designated spot. You could also take a close-up shot of something small, like an insect, next to an object with a standard size, like a penny. Then you can compare features of the insect, such as its size, to pictures in a reference book.)</li><li>In the movie theater, the image of the person on screen is taller than the real person. How can you use the same techniques to estimate someone’s height from their image on a movie screen? (Answers will vary. Possible answer: If you know the actual measurement of an object in the image, you can use any of the strategies mentioned earlier to find the person’s actual height.)</li><li>Would you have been able to solve the problem had you not known the magazine was 10 inches tall? (Answers will vary. Possible answer: Yes. I could have measured the height of the actual bookshelf shown in the picture and used that height instead of the height of the magazine.)</li></ul>"

The size change is different based on whether you use the knot closer to the anchor point (3 times larger) or the knot closer to the pencil (1.5 times larger).)</li><li>Do I get exactly the same drawing if I switch the ends of my two-band stretcher? (No. It is rarely the case that the two rubber bands are exactly alike in stretchiness and length. Furthermore, it is very difficult to get the bands to contribute equally to the knot. The net result is usually that the image is a bit more (less) than twice as large as the original in length. Switching the ends of the rubber band will then make the image a bit less (more) than twice as large.)</li><li>How could we use something like the rubber band stretcher to make an image smaller than the original? (This is a bit tricky, but possible to imagine. The standard stretcher method uses the knot to trace the smaller original and the end of the stretcher to trace the larger image. To shrink a figure, we need to switch the roles of the knot and the end. We would need to put a pencil at the knot and use the end of the stretcher to trace the original and have a friend or third hand to help.)</li></ul>"

This is different from the traditional game where the X’s and O’s are placed in the middle of each square. With little instruction, nearly every student will recall how to graph points in a hurry.

One special case that you should help students notice is the case where we multiply the x and y by 1 to get a new figure. In this case the figures are similar. Even more, they are congruent. You get a figure of exactly the same size and shape. This case will occur in Problem 2.2.)</li><li>Are the perimeters related? Are some of them related and others not? How do the perimeters in similar Wumps compare? (Compare some of the perimeters – for example, the mouth or legs or one other part – to show that with Mug, Bug, and Zug, the corresponding perimeters grow the same way. They are multiplied by the same number. Students will begin to notice that if the coefficients of both the x- and y-coordinates of the rule are the same, the figure is similar to the original. If the coefficients are different, the figure will change more in one direction than the other and will be distorted. One special case that you should help students notice is the case where we multiply the x and y by 1 to get a new figure. In this case the figures are similar. Even more, they are congruent. You get a figure of exactly the same size and shape. This case will occur in Problem 2.2.)</li><li>Could you use ratios or “for every” statements to describe the characters that are similar to Mug? (Yes. For example, Bug is Similar to Mug. For every side length on Mug the corresponding side length on Bug is three times as long.  The ratio to represent a side length on Mug and its corresponding side length on Bug is 1:3.)</li><li>For What If Situation A, which claims are correct? Why? (Marta, Jacob, and Billie are correct. Students should be able to talk about how the numbers in front of x and y (coefficients) must be the same so that all the side lengths increase by the same multiplier. Students should also recognize that the angles stayed the same in the Wump family members.)</li><li>What are some rules you could use to create a figure similar to Lug in What If Situation B?  (Answers will vary but the rule should have x and y multiplied by the same number.  Students may not have mastered using the rules at this point. They will have time to develop this further in the rest of this Investigation.)</li></ul>"

In addition, they will be able to distinguish rules that produce similar figures from rules that do not produce similar figures, recognizing the role that multiplication plays in scaled drawings or similarity relationships.

Some might say that the perimeter = 2(ℓ+ w), and if the scale factor is 2, then the new perimeter = 2(2ℓ + 2w) and this is just double the original perimeter. A few students might recognize that 2(2ℓ + 2w) = 2 × 2(ℓ + w) or that in the expression 2(2ℓ + 2w), the factor 2 ℓ + 2w is the perimeter of the original rectangle.)</li><li>Let’s go in the reverse direction.

Rep‑tiling allows students to revisit similarity in a new context. In deciding how to put rep‑tiles together, students identify relationships between the scale factor, side lengths, and areas of similar figures. For example, they find that if the scale factor from a smaller quadrilateral to a larger quadrilateral is 2, the side lengths and perimeter grow by a factor of 2. The area, however, grows by a factor of 22, or 4.</p>"

It is important that students focus on the two triangles. The corresponding side lengths will link the sides of the small triangle to sides of the large triangle, not the trapezoid.)</li><li>Are the triangles in the river diagram similar?  How do you know? (The triangle formed by Stakes 1, 2, and 3 is similar to the triangle formed by Stake 3 and Trees 1 and 2.  These triangles have angles that are congruent.  The angle at Tree 1 is 90° and corresponds to the angle at Stake 1 which is also 90°. The triangles share the angle formed at Stake 3. The angle formed at Tree 2 has the same measure as the angle formed at Stake 2. This is because the line segment from Tree 1 to Tree 2 is parallel to the line segment from Stake 1 to Stake 2 and the angle at Stake 2 corresponds to the angle at Tree 2.  The important features of this figure are that Tree 1, Stake 1 and Stake 3 are on the same line; Tree 2, Stake 2, and Stake 3 are on the same line; and the segments connecting Stakes 1 and 2 and Trees 1 and 2 are parallel. These conditions allow students to use their knowledge of transversals.) </li></ul>"
