You may want to introduce the term nested in the Launch for this Problem to describe the two triangles pictured in Problem 3.3 in the Student Edition. It is a handy, though nontechnical, way to describe a smaller triangle within a larger triangle, where the triangles share an angle.  (Language)</p>",
            "<p>In the two previous Problems, we used the fact that if two triangles have congruent corresponding angles, then the triangles are similar. This is not generally true for other polygons. Explain why this is not true for parallelograms or rectangles. ( All rectangles have four 90Â° angles, yet not all rectangles are similar. Corresponding side lengths in two rectangles can have different scale factors. Likewise, for any parallelogram, we can stretch just one pair of sides, as in the diagram below. The parallelogram maintains the same angles but results in a figure that is not similar to the original.) </p>"
