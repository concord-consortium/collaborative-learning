            "<p><strong>Problem Overview</strong></p>",
            "<p>In this Problem, students investigate the effects that various algebraic rules have on the shape and location of a figure on a coordinate grid. The figure is a hat for Mug. Students explore what happens to the location of the hat when numbers are added to or subtracted from each coordinate. The figures are similar but may have changed location. In addition, they will be able to distinguish rules that produce similar figures from rules that do not produce similar figures, recognizing the role that multiplication plays in scaled drawings or similarity relationships. This geometric setting will lay a foundation for students later work on proportional relationships in Comparing and Scaling and Moving Straight Ahead. </p>"
