This is because of the imperfection of the bands and some differences in the application of the method. The result is more accurate if the end of the rubber band on point P is fixed by holding a pin instead of holding by hand directly; if the image end of the band is held as close to the page as possible using the pencil; if the pencil chosen is as thin as possible since its thickness might cause the band in the image end to be shorter than it is supposed to be; if the bands are not stretched too much.</p>"

On a sunny day, any upright object casts a shadow.
