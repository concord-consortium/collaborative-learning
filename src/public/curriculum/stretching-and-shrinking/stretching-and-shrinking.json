Students may see that approximately 4 of the original rectangles (hats) can fit into the enlarged rectangle (hat). If students say the areas are three or four times as large, this is fine at this stage. The important idea is that the area is more than twice as large. </li><li>The distances of each figure from the anchor point P also have a 2 to 1 ratio. That is, each point on the image is twice the distance from P as the original corresponding point is from P. </li></ul>",
                        "<p>Note that the answers above are true in the ideal case. In practice, the 2 to 1 ratio of the lengths (and the 4 to 1 ratio of the areas) will not always be observed. This is because of the imperfection of the bands and some differences in the application of the method. The result is more accurate if the end of the rubber band on point P is fixed by holding a pin instead of holding by hand directly; if the image end of the band is held as close to the page as possible using the pencil; if the pencil chosen is as thin as possible since its thickness might cause the band in the image end to be shorter than it is supposed to be; if the bands are not stretched too much.</p>"
