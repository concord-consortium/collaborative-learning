            "<p>The Computer Club at P.I. Middle School also meets monthly. Zack and Marta suggested that the club design a computer game that involves several animated characters. They ask Martaâ€™s uncle Carlos, a programmer for a video game company, about computer animation.</p><p>Carlos explains that the computer screen can be thought of as a grid made up of thousands of tiny points, called pixels. To animate a figure, we need to enter the coordinates of key points on the figure. The computer uses these points to draw the figure in different positions.</p><p>Sometimes the figures in a computer game need to change size. A change in the programming code can make a figure larger or smaller. We can code a rule for finding key points from the original figure. In this Investigation, we will explore answers to these questions.</p><p><em>Do the rules create scale drawings? That is, are the two figures similar?</em></p><p>The following problems will help us answer these questions.</p>"
