/*
 * FocusDocumentTracker
 *
 * This component is basically a hook wrapped in a functional component so that
 * it can be called from a class component (NavTabPanel in this case). It's basic
 * purpose is to walk the DOM to figure out what user document or curriculum section
 * is currently visible in the left-side navigation panel for the purpose of deciding
 * what document or curriculum section can be commented upon in the comments panel.
 * We had been trying to determine this by tracking clicks in the various tab headers
 * but this was getting increasingly complicated and wasn't working very well. This
 * ties the behavior of the comments panel to what's actually visible to the user, as
 * it should be. The mechanism is that components that are responsible for presenting
 * documents or curriculum sections to the user add a `data-focus-document` or
 * `data-focus-section` attribute which can then be detected when we crawl the
 * DOM thus guaranteeing that we're finding the top-most visible documents/sections.
