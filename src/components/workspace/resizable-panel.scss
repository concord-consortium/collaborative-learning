  // the total width

  // In theory the following timing function should make the width change linearly with time,
  // but it didn't work well. It was created by using an evaluation engine to take the output
  // of the cubic-bezier and feed it in as x in y = x / (x + 1). The cubic-bezier params were
  // tweaked until the graph of y was pretty linear between 0 and 1.
  // transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.5, 0.2, 0.7, 0.4)
