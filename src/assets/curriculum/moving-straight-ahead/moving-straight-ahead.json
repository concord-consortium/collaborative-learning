For example, the distance, d, a person walks at a constant rate depends on the amount of time, t, the person walks. Also, the amount of money, A, a person raises from each sponsor depends on the distance, d, walked in the walkathon. Both of these relationships are linear. You might have written the following equations to represent these two relationships for Alana."

Because Emile’s walking rate is faster, Emile gives Henri a 45-meter head start. Emile knows his brother would enjoy winning the race, but he does not want to make the race so short that it is obvious his brother will win."

The steepness of stairs determines how difficult they are to climb. By investigating the steepness of stairs, you can find another important way to describe the steepness of a line. \n\nCarpenters have developed the guidelines below to ensure that the stairs they build are relatively easy for a person to climb. Steps are measured in inches. \n\n  • Twice the rise plus the run for each step should be between 24 and 26 inches.\n  • The rise plus the run for each step should be between 17 and 19 inches.  \n\nThe steepness of stairs is determined by the ratio of the rise to the run for each step.
