This is a very basic tile that can be used to start work on a new tile.

# Demo

This vlist tile can be demo'd with these URL params:
`?demo&unit=example`

Look for the `St` tool, that is how you can add this tile to the document.

# Making a new tile based on this one

- You should copy the `vlist` folder.
- rename all text `vlist` and `VList`
- rename all filenames with the word `vlist` in them
- update `src/register-tools.ts` to import your new tile's registration module.
