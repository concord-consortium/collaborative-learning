     * The shared model is identified by an id inside of the snapshot The
     * sourceTreeId indicates which tree is sending this update. The new shared
     * model snapshot will not be sent back to this source.
     *
     * Note: The returned promise should only resolve after the shared model has
     * been updated in the container and in all trees that are using the shared
     * model. The promise does not guarantee that all of the tiles have updated
     * their own objects related to the shared model. In particular when this is
     * called when applying patches from an undo or redo, the tiles will
     * explicitly not update their related objects because they will receive
     * patches that should contain these changes separately.
     *
     * This promise is needed because we need to stop some updating before
     * replaying a history event, and then we need to start it up again
     * afterward. So we need to know when the history event has been fully
     * applied. When the history event includes changes to a shared model, fully
     * applying it means the tree of the shared model has sent its changes to
     * all of the trees that are using it. So when the shared model tree gets
     * the applyContainerPatches call it then calls this updateSharedModel and
     * waits for it to resolve before resolving its own promise. 
     *
     * The returned promise will also be used when a user event is sent, we need
     * to make sure the container has received this update message before the
     * tree tells the container is done modifying the historyEntry. In this case
     * it isn't necessary for the returned promise to wait until all of the
     * trees have received the message. That could be the responsibility of the
     * container. Perhaps we can simplify this so this call doesn't need to
     * block until all of the trees using the shared model have been notified.
     * That blocking could be the responsiblity of the container after this call
     * is done.

     * Trees should call this to start a new history entry. These history
     * entries are used for 2 things:
     * - the state of the document that is saved and later loaded

     * all of the recorded tree patch records and send that to the tree with
     * with `applyContainerPatches`.

     * the the recorded tree patch records that are grouped by the
     * historyEntryId to the tree with `applyContainerPatches`.

     * and then call a `addTreePatchRecord`. If the tree is also calling
     * `updateSharedModel` it should wait both the updateSharedModel and the
     * `addHistoryEntry` to resolve before calling `addTreePatchRecord`. Calling
     * `addTreePatchRecord` is necessary so the container knows the tree is done
     * sending information about this historyEntryId. Because other trees might
     * respond to a sharedModel update with further changes to other
     * sharedModels this might trigger another change back in the original tree.

     * the callId parameter is used. 
     *
     * The reason why we don't just use addTreePatchRecord to start the history
     * entry is because some actions don't have any patches in their own tree
     * but they change a shared model owned by another tree. In that case we
     * wan't to record the initiating tree and action so there is more info for
     * the researcher.

     * addTreePatchRecord message with the same callId.
