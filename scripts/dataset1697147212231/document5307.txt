Example: Team A made 108/126 attempts, or  6 scored free throws/7 total free throws on average (85.714 percent). Team B made 195/257 attempts, or 75.875 percent of their free throws. Therefore, Team A had a better accuracy rate. Another strategy Sid could use is finding the GCF of 195 and 108 (how many they scored). It is 3, so Sid could divide both sides of both fractions by the number required to make both of their numerators 3. Because 108 (Team A) is 36 * 3, we must divide by 36 to get a numerator of 3. We also need to divide the denominator (126) by 3 to keep the rate of scored free throws to free throws. Therefore, Team A has a denominator of 3.5 for a numerator of 3, or it would take 3.5 free throws on average at the same rate of 108/126 to score 3 free throws. Because 195 (Team B) is 65 * 3, we must divide the numerator and denominator (257) by 65. Therefore, Team B has a denominator of around 3.95 for a numerator of 3, or it would take 3.95 free throws on average to score 3 free throws. We get a solution of Team A has a better accuracy rate, because it takes less free throws to score the same amount of free throws as Team B.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"Kcq03dqhP-1EEmyz":{"id":"Kcq03dqhP-1EEmyz","title":"Text 3","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Free Throws\",\"bold\":true},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Two basketball teams recently competed in free throw attempts.
