Example: Team A made 108/126 attempts, or  6 scored free throws/7 total free throws on average (85.714 percent). Team B made 195/257 attempts, or 75.875 percent of their free throws. Therefore, Team A had a better accuracy rate. Another strategy Sid could use is finding the GCF of 195 and 108 (how many they scored). It is 3, so Sid could divide both sides of both fractions by the number required to make both of their numerators 3. Because 108 (Team A) is 36 * 3, we must divide by 36 to get a numerator of 3. We also need to divide the denominator (126) by 3 to keep the rate of scored free throws to free throws. Therefore, Team A has a denominator of 3.5 for a numerator of 3, or it would take 3.5 free throws on average at the same rate of 108/126 to score 3 free throws. Because 195 (Team B) is 65 * 3, we must divide the numerator and denominator (257) by 65. Therefore, Team B has a denominator of around 3.95 for a numerator of 3, or it would take 3.95 free throws on average to score 3 free throws. We get a solution of Team A has a better accuracy rate, because it takes fewer free throws to score the same amount of free throws as Team B.\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"2020 Census Population Data: The population of people under the age of 18 in 2010 can be represented as x. We know that a 1.4% decline of x results in 73.1 million, so 100 percent (1 whole) - 1.4 percent (decline from 2010 population to 2020 population) = 98.6 percent (percent of x that the 2020 population is). Therefore, 73.1 million = 0.986x, or 73.1 million = 98.6 percent of x. Dividing both sides by 0.986 to isolate the variable on one side, we get 74.1379310345 million = x. Because x is the 2010 population of people under 18, then the 2010 population of people under 18 will be 74,137,931 approximately. If the decline of people under 18 continued at this rate, then by 2030 the population under 18 is around 72.1 million, and then 2040 shows a population of around 71.1 million (as shown by the table and graph). The equation I used to find the population under 18 for any given year (even before the year 2000,  assuming the same rate continues) at the declination rate of 1.4% is f(x) = 0.986 ^ ((x - 2000)/10) * 75189655.1724... according to that, by the year AD 20000 the human population under 18 in the US will be so small it's basically 0. The reason why this equation works even before the year 2000 is because a positive number to the power of a negative number is still positive (for 0.986, is 0.986/0.986^negative 1 times the negative power).\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"0c7aMClvLrg0JVMM":{"id":"0c7aMClvLrg0JVMM","title":"Text 3","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Free Throws\",\"bold\":true},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Two basketball teams recently competed in free throw attempts.
