The walking rate is how many meters per second each brother walks, or the coefficient of time. Because we know the coefficient of time in each equation, we can easily tell that Emile's walking rate is 2.5 meters per second and Henri's is 1 meter per second. The y-intercept is the y when x is 0; in other words, it is the distance that each brother starts at. In the equation, this is the additive value that does not depend on the independent variable. This is 0 for Emile (Emile's y-intercept is 0) and 45 for Henri (Henri's y-intercept is 45). \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #2 is also correct. How steep something is is rise divided by run- how much the y increases for some increase of x divided by that increase of x. The increase of y for 1 increase in x for Emile is 2.5, and it is 1 for Henri. Therefore, Emile's line is steeper.\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #3 is incorrect. Both equations are linear, because y increases by the same amount for each increase of 1 in x, but \\\"neither of them are proportional\\\" is not true. While Henri's equation is not a proportional relationship (the y-intercept is not 0 because of his head start), Emile's is a proportional relationship because there are no additive values in his equation.\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #4 is correct. 2.5t is Emile's distance, and 45 + 1t is Henri's distance. The equation says those values are equal, so Henri's distance must be equivalent to Emile's distance. Then you can find t (one equation one variable) and that will be the time required for Henri's distance to match Emile's distance (when Emile catches Henri).\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #5 is correct. The distance the brothers are apart is the [absolute value, because the distance is always positive unless there is a direction] difference between their two distances. Henri's distance is 45 + 1t meters and Emile's distance is 2.5t, so the distance between the two brothers is |2.5t - (45 + 1t)| or |.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}}},"sharedModelMap":{"6hGvDGNkwsBZTaGr":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"6hGvDGNkwsBZTaGr","providerId":"e-qdleXHxjO27O-P","dataSet":{"id":"CFIzgUml5B94IBgd","name":"Table 1","attributes":[{"id":"XCXCwf5rPUoHplIN","clientKey":"","name":"Time ","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","20","25","30","0","29","30.00"]},{"id":"lpMRdRFcLWEdLdx-","clientKey":"","name":"Distance","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{"display":"x+45","canonical":"(__x__ + 45)"},"values":[46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,65,70,75,45,74,null]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"QTRpADbNIF1fATQC"},{"__id__":"L6fZ3rEL-T5Q4b6z"},{"__id__":"Clwsj6qAyy1dO7oF"},{"__id__":"tOHNfsslyYW5mcMS"},{"__id__":"slEfuqCjdyuAj27S"},{"__id__":"RDuQkkXEDTnlc7YD"},{"__id__":"BqcHgDrh7d5oLhcZ"},{"__id__":"1KrNqiCHbiQaVE8l"},{"__id__":"oJpt8a4I0Gp5wQ23"},{"__id__":"7JA0GUesi_0qYZXp"},{"__id__":"4e3pwb4-VFx41mrI"},{"__id__":"3qmxwc-sGgS0nNtH"},{"__id__":"8-d0mojBbKY3cakP"},{"__id__":"VlSXlKJwx0cu5c-v"},{"__id__":"D2K1e61mDUho2pwd"},{"__id__":"NbVq034ODkNytSNy"}]}},"tiles":["e-qdleXHxjO27O-P","I7OP4qRBtGtqn9Sm","hApPSuGOZv7fDaGl"]},"3lj24CEr7l5TlGnI":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"3lj24CEr7l5TlGnI","providerId":"wil-ZcZ8CwpGjD69","dataSet":{"id":"5r1Bh4sVgoJw4cSQ","name":"Table 2","attributes":[{"id":"lkOAyzNB0a7fF79V","clientKey":"","name":"Time","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","20","25","30","0","29","29.6","30"]},{"id":"NWNZAF3f7SvycrjC","clientKey":"","name":"Distance","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{"display":"x * 2.5","canonical":"(__x__ * 2.5)"},"values":[2.5,5,7.5,10,12.5,15,17.5,20,22.5,25,50,62.5,75,0,72.5,74,null]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"74KDVXs1jhWcux9T"},{"__id__":"EOspbo-u5XUPTLs9"},{"__id__":"AkANIGsSsA26NIzh"},{"__id__":"Ehq5nypNFyfZ8Rza"},{"__id__":"6_gixaHbY5-qdkWV"},{"__id__":"OQQc-_F4P068Y3Yx"},{"__id__":"7uU6CJ79uIdMIpRm"},{"__id__":"xa90RcESU6ABKcbv"},{"__id__":"vVEH9_Bb_-ST69GA"},{"__id__":"LETqAdlKH01ijDA7"},{"__id__":"V_OauoiUhFD50OJz"},{"__id__":"f1om5nNQ08XIYWT7"},{"__id__":"-H_ADjvYwrB7kcvl"},{"__id__":"ckDDhyHmBtw5MkjQ"},{"__id__":"HG4KQ7hne8YS-Pth"},{"__id__":"t2eCgsSiDGK3LWSp"},{"__id__":"hICDYrVdf0Hdrj0e"}]}},"tiles":["wil-ZcZ8CwpGjD69","I7OP4qRBtGtqn9Sm","hApPSuGOZv7fDaGl"]},"XXhMJtwYcTYoVR4W":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"XXhMJtwYcTYoVR4W","providerId":"KpY_yWhapKkpkgmV","dataSet":{"id":"wEk0yO2RDpt2Cd9i","name":"Table 3","attributes":[{"id":"iM7Fnrt7ulWQ_PZH","clientKey":"","name":"x","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["","2"]},{"id":"ZtQaGT_YgEyj9D63","clientKey":"","name":"y","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["2","3"]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"ZbGRij7LVoKzCszC"},{"__id__":"B2qFh0QquUbnE375"}]}},"tiles":["hApPSuGOZv7fDaGl"]}}}
