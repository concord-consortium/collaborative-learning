This is represented on the table because the amount of money they have decreases by 12 as the weeks goes up. For                Mr. Mamer's class,  he starts at $500 and decreases at a rate of $50 per every 5 weeks. This can be converted into  $10 per every week. ($50/$5 5w/5w) This is represented in the graph as it starts on 0,500 and continues at a rate of +1w and -$10. This pattern is the same as the other patterns in problem because this pattern is linear. In the other problems we have explored, we saw the rising amount of money because of the sponsors giving them money for the walking kilometers. Now we are focusing on the fact that the the people who did the walkathon, are giving away their money they earned from their sponsors. Mr. Mamer's class,  he starts at $500 and decreases at a rate of $50 per every 5 weeks. This can be converted into  $10 per every week. ($50/$5 5w/5w) This is represented in the graph as it starts on 0,500 and continues at a rate of +1w and -$10.  This pattern is the same as other problems because of the fact that this graph is also linear. This shows a constant rate of change like we have seen before. But this graph, shows a declining rate unlike others we have seen which increased as we have seen them get paid by the sponsors so in the past, we have seen an increasing rate.  This graph deceases because they are donating the money that the kids have earned from the walkathon so these 2 graphs show 2 different outcomes.Both of these are linear because of the fact that the data all increase at a constant rate but both of these cannot be proportional because they don't cross through the origin.  These both have a additive value, Ms. Chang's class starts of at $144 at 0 weeks. The starting 144 is additive. This states that the table Ms. Chang has can only be linear and cannot be proportional.  Mr. Mamer's class starts at  500 bucks at beginning. Then he goes down by 10 bucks a week. Because of the additive start at the beginning, Mr. Mamer's graph cannot be proportional. But because of the fact that he has a constant change in the variables, his graph is linear.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"a4imziiYMgkwjOFh":{"id":"a4imziiYMgkwjOFh","content":{"type":"Placeholder","sectionId":"nowWhatDoYouKnow"}},"U6SmJPmLP6S9GEXI":{"id":"U6SmJPmLP6S9GEXI","title":"Graph 1","content":{"type":"Geometry","board":{"xAxis":{"min":-1,"unit":41.92307692307692,"range":13},"yAxis":{"min":-1,"unit":2.26027397260274,"range":146}},"objects":{"f9XgMCumPhm7b8I3":{"type":"polygon","id":"f9XgMCumPhm7b8I3","points":["01GX3Q08VJWEBGG5EE0NK3WRYE:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","01GX3Q08VJWEBGG5EE0NK3WRYF:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","01GX3Q08VJWEBGG5EE0NK3WRYG:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","01GX3Q08VJWEBGG5EE0NK3WRYH:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","01GX3Q08VJWEBGG5EE0NK3WRYJ:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","01GX3Q08VJWEBGG5EE0NK3WRYK:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8"]},"sjOZS8x2z5-i6Hd-":{"type":"polygon","id":"sjOZS8x2z5-i6Hd-","points":["qY6CPugIyoS5YV79:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","N-hgdsYmn6pERJ7k:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","L9jOIA1P4bJZzyZ8:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","f-Db5aPpsbGJ2LiN:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8"]},"HOuhQ11IPBgPKwJX":{"type":"point","id":"HOuhQ11IPBgPKwJX","x":5,"y":83.99999999999994,"snapToGrid":true,"snapSizeX":0.1,"snapSizeY":0.1},"wV75mGZOXEZANnj5":{"type":"point","id":"wV75mGZOXEZANnj5","x":5.9999999999999964,"y":72.00000000000006,"snapToGrid":true,"snapSizeX":0.1,"snapSizeY":0.1},"3RzQMUQ3tbRZYshu":{"type":"polygon","id":"3RzQMUQ3tbRZYshu","points":["HOuhQ11IPBgPKwJX","wV75mGZOXEZANnj5"]},"sgHF9z1oO3BDwQER":{"type":"polygon","id":"sgHF9z1oO3BDwQER","points":["lP5iRxnVgz5u6Jg-:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","JLx3G8w40HOTQ3bO:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8","SudLJ5Gmyhaoia_U:l-MX4xiwmFtbMVc8"]}}}},"0tAnHF5pNAmoO2wq":{"id":"0tAnHF5pNAmoO2wq","content":{"type":"Placeholder","sectionId":"nowWhatDoYouKnow"}},"3F7nITvb7YQR_3d6":{"id":"3F7nITvb7YQR_3d6","title":"Text 18","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Situation A.
