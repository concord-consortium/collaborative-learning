As students share their strategies, it is important to be clear about what comparisons are being made by the ratios. When students use certain strategies, such as scaling a ratio to an equivalent ratio, be sure to call attention to that strategy for the class. With unit rates, it is important for students to see how scaling a ratio so that one quantity is 1 connects to dividing to find a unit rate. </p>","<p>MAKING THE MATHEMATICS EXPLICIT</p>","<p>Strategies from students: (many examples given in the extended LES in the Teacher Guide)</p>","<ul><li>Reasoning with pictures and estimation</li><li>How much pizza for a fixed number of people</li><li>How many people for a fixed number of pizzas</li></ul>","<p><strong>Suggested questions</strong></p>","<ul><li>How much pizza for a fixed number of people.</li><li>How many people share a fixed number of pizzas</li><li>What quantities are you comparing?
