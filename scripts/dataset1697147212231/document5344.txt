For No-Shrink Tees, the equation is Cost = 4.5 * T-Shirts because the y-intercept is 0 and the cost increases by 4.5 per t-shirt. Then we linked the tables to a graph to compare where the lines intersect. Where they intersect is the point that No-Shrink's cost overtakes Might Tees. Looking at the graph, we see that No-Shrink (green) catches up to Mighty at what looks like 14 t-shirts. Plugging in 14 for T-Shirts in the equation, we get 49 + 14 = 63 dollars for Mighty and 4.5 * 14 = 63 dollars for No-Shrink. Therefore, Mighty is cheaper than No-Shrink past 14 shirts. Conclusion: If less than 14 people participate in the Walkathon, then the class should purchase No-Shrink. If 14 people participate, it does not matter.

This tells you that at 14 t-shirts, the cost is the same, and it doesn't matter which company you choose. From there, you can easily figure out that past 14 T-shirts, Mighty is cheaper, and before 14 T-shirts, No-Shrink is cheaper. However, Monica would have to tell us which company was cheaper before 14 tees and which company, more expensive, past 14 tees. Roland's strategy gets somewhere but doesn't have any actual information. If you assume the class has $120, you can plug that into the cost-to-T-shirts for Mighty and No-Shrink and find which will get you more T-shirts for $120. Mighty is $ = 49 + Tees, so if $ is 120, we get 120 = 49 + Tees. Subtracting 49 from both sides we get 120 - 49 = 49 - 49 + Tees or 71 = Tees. Therefore, you can buy 71 tees from Mighty for the cost of $120. If you plug in $120 to $ = 4.5 * Tees, you get 120 = 4.5 * Tees. Dividing both sides by 4.5 to isolate the variable, we have 120/4.5 = 4.5/4.5 * Tees or finally 26 2/3 = Tees. Because you can't buy 2/3 of a tee, you can only buy 26 tees. Roland now knows that Mighty is cheaper at least past 26 tees. This is somewhat a place to start finding the intersection point, but all in all it is kind of useless (you only need the breakeven point to solve the problem). Naomi's strategy works- if you find the number of T-shirts that satisfy the inequality, then you will get the information \\\"when is Mighty cheaper than No-Shrink?\\\" This in turn will tell you the intersection point, because you can find the point where Mighty is just below the number of T-shirts where it is cheaper, which will also tell you that below the intersection point No-Shrink is cheaper. You can substitute the expression for CMighty on the left and the expression for CNo-Shrink on the right, getting 49 + Tees < 4.5 * Tees. The lowest value that the inequality is true is 15, so we know the breakeven point is just under 15 (14).\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"2BjTjMVnmQVt_bUZ":{"id":"2BjTjMVnmQVt_bUZ","title":"Text 22","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Monicaâ€™s Strategy\",\"underlined\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I found the number of \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"T-shirts when the cost of the two companies is equal.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"cGerG6D4GVY4nrEs":{"id":"cGerG6D4GVY4nrEs","title":"Text 21","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Rolandâ€™s Strategy\",\"underlined\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I assumed that the class had $120 to spend. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"lhq0mzgflpR9fz6D":{"id":"lhq0mzgflpR9fz6D","title":"Text 23","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Naomiâ€™s Strategy\",\"underlined\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\" I wrote the inequality \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"CMighty < CNo-Shrink. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I found the number of T- shirts that satisfy this inequality. \"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"b_Yj3ImKlEdoDTDA":{"id":"b_Yj3ImKlEdoDTDA","title":"Text 33","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Situation B.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 4.5, you get Tees = 30, so you can buy 30 tees from No-Shrink for $135. For less than $135, you can only buy less than 86 tees from Mighty (even 1 cent less and you won't be able to purchase the full 86 tees, and any less would result in just being able to purchase less tees) and less than 30 tees from No-Shrink. For more than $135, we can only say that you can purchase greater than or equal to 86 tees for Mighty (since if you have less than 138 dollars you can't purchase another whole tee) and greater than or equal to 30 tees for No-Shrink.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"GpUXeYzN43JTBIWI":{"id":"GpUXeYzN43JTBIWI","title":"Text 42","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"bulleted-list\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"list-item\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Nic saw the point (50,99) on one of his graphs.

Now, because between 34 and 41.5 dollars, there is a difference of 7.5 dollars and a difference of 3 tees, I can simplify $7.5 = 3 tees into $2.5 = 1 tee (divide both sides by 3). Therefore, the slope is 2.5 and we can finish the equation: Dollars = 34 (y-intercept) + 2.5 * n (slope). Plugging this into the table, I put in several values for x at varying intervals and linked The Big Tee, Mighty, and No-Shrink's table to the same graph. The cost of Big Tee is in-between Mighty and No-Shrink up until 10 tees, where it intersects with Mighty and then overtakes Mighty. Then it is the most costly option until 17 tees, where it intersects No-Shrink and is overtaken. After that, it will always be more expensive than Mighty but always cheaper than No-Shrink. Plugging 12 tees in for 12 into the equation, we get Dollars = 34 + 2.5 * 12, or 34 + 30 = 64. Therefore, 12 tees cost $64 if purchasing from The Big Tee. All relationships are linear, because they are straight lines, but only No-Shrink is proportional because the others have a nonzero y-intercept (don't go through the origin; an additive change in the equation; a fixed fee).\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"lri-TOwF3SplR-6T":{"id":"lri-TOwF3SplR-6T","title":"Text 47","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"bulleted-list\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"list-item\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Compare the cost for this company to the costs for the other two companies.\"}]}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"nA2O8SJ5feI5iOvR":{"id":"nA2O8SJ5feI5iOvR","title":"The Big Tee","content":{"type":"Table","isImported":true,"importedDataSet":{"id":"Rb64JcXGeJh8Xyvr","attributes":[],"cases":[]},"columnWidths":{"kRRHu1XEzUD_X7XS":80,"JpG7QC5eR8g5zYy5":80}}},"0z4yQSjmu7sbPZHZ":{"id":"0z4yQSjmu7sbPZHZ","title":"Text 50","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"What is the cost of 12 T-shirts?\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"H7IS-HVqqhMCtO4N":{"id":"H7IS-HVqqhMCtO4N","title":"Text 59","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"bulleted-list\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"list-item\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Are any of the relationships represented by the three companies linear?
