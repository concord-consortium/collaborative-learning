For No-Shrink Tees, the equation is Cost = 4.5 * T-Shirts because the y-intercept is 0 and the cost increases by 4.5 per t-shirt. Then we linked the tables to a graph to compare where the lines intersect. Where they intersect is the point that No-Shrink's cost overtakes Might Tees. Looking at the graph, we see that No-Shrink (green) catches up to Mighty at what looks like 14 t-shirts. Plugging in 14 for T-Shirts in the equation, we get 49 + 14 = 63 dollars for Mighty and 4.5 * 14 = 63 dollars for No-Shrink. Therefore, Mighty is cheaper than No-Shrink past 14 shirts. Conclusion: If less than 14 people participate in the Walkathon, then the class should purchase No-Shrink. If 14 people participate, it does not matter.

This tells you that at 14 t-shirts, the cost is the same, and it doesn't matter which company you choose. From there, you can easily figure out that past 14 T-shirts, Mighty is cheaper, and before 14 T-shirts, No-Shrink is cheaper. However, Monica would have to tell us which company was cheaper before 14 tees and which company, more expensive, past 14 tees. Roland's strategy gets somewhere but doesn't have any actual information. If you assume the class has $120, you can plug that into the cost-to-T-shirts for Mighty and No-Shrink and find which will get you more T-shirts for $120. Mighty is $ = 49 + Tees, so if $ is 120, we get 120 = 49 + Tees. Subtracting 49 from both sides we get 120 - 49 = 49 - 49 + Tees or 71 = Tees. Therefore, you can buy 71 tees from Mighty for the cost of $120. If you plug in $120 to $ = 4.5 * Tees, you get 120 = 4.5 * Tees. Dividing both sides by 4.5 to isolate the variable, we have 120/4.5 = 4.5/4.5 * Tees or finally 26 2/3 = Tees. Because you can't buy 2/3 of a tee, you can only buy 26 tees. Roland now knows that Mighty is cheaper at least past 26 tees. This is somewhat a place to start finding the intersection point, but all in all it is kind of useless (you only need the breakeven point to solve the problem). Naomi's strategy works- if you find the number of T-shirts that satisfy the inequality, then you will get the information \\\"when is Mighty cheaper than No-Shrink?\\\" This in turn will tell you the intersection point, because you can find the point where Mighty is just below the number of T-shirts where it is cheaper, which will also tell you that below the intersection point No-Shrink is cheaper. You can substitute the expression for CMighty on the left and the expression for CNo-Shrink on the right, getting 49 + Tees < 4.5 * Tees. The lowest value that the inequality is true is 15, so we know the breakeven point is just under 15 (14).\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"78VgQflSZiKGIc_y":{"id":"78VgQflSZiKGIc_y","title":"Text 22","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Monicaâ€™s Strategy\",\"underlined\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I found the number of \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"T-shirts when the cost of the two companies is equal.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"Y9hKDefJsSApF6qQ":{"id":"Y9hKDefJsSApF6qQ","title":"Text 21","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Rolandâ€™s Strategy\",\"underlined\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I assumed that the class had $120 to spend. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"OPEGu7Knd7PdrN5F":{"id":"OPEGu7Knd7PdrN5F","title":"Text 23","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Naomiâ€™s Strategy\",\"underlined\":true}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\" I wrote the inequality \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"CMighty < CNo-Shrink. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I found the number of T- shirts that satisfy this inequality. \"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"fiAqUduqihOKpHXN":{"id":"fiAqUduqihOKpHXN","title":"Text 33","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Situation B.

For less than $135, you can only buy less than 86 tees from Mighty (even 1 cent less and you won't be able to purchase the full 86 tees, and any less would result in just being able to purchase less tees) and less than 30 tees from No-Shrink. For more than $135, we can only say that you can purchase greater than or equal to 86 tees for Mighty (since if you have less than 138 dollars you can't purchase another whole tee) and greater than or equal to 30 tees for No-Shrink.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"3lXC7ADTm2lBPHX3":{"id":"3lXC7ADTm2lBPHX3","title":"Text 42","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"bulleted-list\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"list-item\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Nic saw the point (50,99) on one of his graphs.
