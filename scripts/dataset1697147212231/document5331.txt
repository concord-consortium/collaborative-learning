Because 74 minus 45 is 29, and Henri walks 1 m/s, it will take Henri 29 seconds to walk 74 meters. If we divide 74 by 2.5 (to find how long it would take Emile,  because he walks 2.5 m/s) , we get 29.6 seconds, meaning it would take Emile 29.6 to walk 74 meters. Therefore, Emile would be just slightly slower.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}}},"sharedModelMap":{"dW6zt5sC3KvW7uxf":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"dW6zt5sC3KvW7uxf","providerId":"K44q0BCcqvqqTsvl","dataSet":{"id":"8VySGk_UlYRKzg35","name":"Henri","attributes":[{"id":"rImottoho3-BWApY","clientKey":"","name":"Time (S)","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["0","1","2","10","25","35","50","100",""]},{"id":"uINpxIwRVBBl80sf","clientKey":"","name":"Meters","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{"display":"x + 45","canonical":"(__x__ + 45)"},"values":[45,46,47,55,70,80,95,145,null]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"0TVQZ85rKvPRUmfM"},{"__id__":"OTJ0JJOqTq53R4Xx"},{"__id__":"1tsja_liTH4V4yw2"},{"__id__":"3W9Qcd3dBFQF2Q9A"},{"__id__":"Z4BBhZzBGOQ-fKxb"},{"__id__":"yCWHbmBD5NFXMbt7"},{"__id__":"hiepX3fUI9UrzDlB"},{"__id__":"EEUbsI-Havv5oyo5"},{"__id__":"WYG8LWz0Gl3Hxuoz"}]}},"tiles":["b2rNgkZ5XnDW0CHO","VortZrD-NVRmQp7x"]},"XK6vGVxLp5NoJT8L":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"XK6vGVxLp5NoJT8L","providerId":"WDzaIc3NthtE-_H0","dataSet":{"id":"ZAMEDmHYBVUgF7Qh","name":"Emile","attributes":[{"id":"xeVQL5KzgPdfInlE","clientKey":"","name":"Time (S)","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["0","1","2","10","25","35","50","100",""]},{"id":"FBc6MFA4wn-MPx9c","clientKey":"","name":"Meters","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{"display":"2.5 * Time (S)","canonical":"(2.5 * __x__)"},"values":[0,2.5,5,25,62.5,87.5,125,250,null]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"Dm10kTCcj5J0FvfS"},{"__id__":"Q4GKHkxQXjGoXJuV"},{"__id__":"D1FDB5YtlYwLnC7a"},{"__id__":"JLd6DyBMsrVrelss"},{"__id__":"RwFmsfNmITCsw0CP"},{"__id__":"rwKMdHGfDWbvzr-M"},{"__id__":"wlqRdWf8ITafZobu"},{"__id__":"kpAFsqFOwumGb73o"},{"__id__":"iEjn6IaVor7dORl8"}]}},"tiles":["xnVjWTh1TOy40wnY"]},"OGRPchSu8PmHVsEG":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"OGRPchSu8PmHVsEG","providerId":"g1kXWIceekqbggBW","dataSet":{"id":"xh9_56YsR66h-JN5","name":"Table 1","attributes":[{"id":"4X4dus6ZqN5nHWro","clientKey":"","name":"x","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":[]},{"id":"4tpf0ZpOSWXdkzsb","clientKey":"","name":"y","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":[]}],"cases":[]}},"tiles":[]}}}
