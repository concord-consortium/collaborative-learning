For the second question, we plug in 12 for $ and 14 for km and we can see that again, our solution is correct. We can use a graph to find the number of km Alana walks if a sponsor donates $17 by finding 17 on the y-axis and looking to the right until we find the point with a y of 17 (the point where Alana earns $17).

The equation gives the information that the slope is 5, or you gain $5 for each km walked. The y-intercept, or additive change in the equation, is -3, suggesting that perhaps the walker is going to buy a $3 t-shirt for their sponsor. All of this is perfectly reasonable. However, Plan 2 is absolute baloney. The y-intercept is 6, so there is a fixed donation of $6. But because the slope is negative 1, that means the walker would LOSE money the farther they walked, which is completely messed up. Plan 3 also makes sense, because there is just a $2 fixed donation and you don't make more money the farther you walk (like Leanne). The slope is 0, because there is a 0 coefficient of x, and the y-intercept is 2 (additive value in equation).\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"0wyqOjlbLeUoInhx":{"id":"0wyqOjlbLeUoInhx","title":"Text 4","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Plan 1\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"  y = 5x – 3\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"ZepFrF3bvTfnToQZ":{"id":"ZepFrF3bvTfnToQZ","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Plan 2\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"  y = –x + 6\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"QyM1ylMza34x_ng-":{"id":"QyM1ylMza34x_ng-","title":"Text 5","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Plan 3\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"  y = 2\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"qBAscIj_3J104iVf":{"id":"qBAscIj_3J104iVf","title":"Text 6","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"bulleted-list\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"list-item\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"What information does the equation give about the pledge plan?
