But because the slope is negative 1, that means the walker would LOSE money the farther they walked, which is completely messed up. Plan 3 also makes sense, because there is just a $2 fixed donation and you don't make more money the farther you walk (like Leanne). The slope is 0, because there is a 0 coefficient of x, and the y-intercept is 2 (additive value in equation). A table helps answer questions by providing specific points for $ and km.
