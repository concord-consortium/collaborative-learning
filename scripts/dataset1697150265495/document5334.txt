The walking rate is how many meters per second each brother walks, or the coefficient of time. Because we know the coefficient of time in each equation, we can easily tell that Emile's walking rate is 2.5 meters per second and Henri's is 1 meter per second. The y-intercept is the y when x is 0; in other words, it is the distance that each brother starts at. In the equation, this is the additive value that does not depend on the independent variable.

The equation says those values are equal, so Henri's distance must be equivalent to Emile's distance. Then you can find t (one equation one variable) and that will be the time required for Henri's distance to match Emile's distance (when Emile catches Henri). Solving the equation: 2.5t - 1t = 45 + 1t - 1t, so 1.5t = 45. 1.5t/1.5 = 45/1.5 and finally t = 30. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #5 is correct. The distance the brothers are apart is the [absolute value, because the distance is always positive unless there is a direction] difference between their two distances. Henri's distance is 45 + 1t meters and Emile's distance is 2.5t, so the distance between the two brothers is |2.5t - (45 + 1t)| or |(45 + 1t) - 2.5t|. For the first way to express it, you are subtracting (45 + 1t), which without parentheses would be written |2.5t - 45 - 1t| (you are subtracting 1t MORE than 45, not you END UP with more). This is equivalent to 45 - (2.5t - 1t), because |2.5t - 45 - 1t| is equivalent to |2.5t - 1t - 45|. We then simplify 2.5t - 1t to 1.5t, so we have |1.5t - 45|.  In Claim 5, 45 - (2.5t - 1t) can be simplified to 45 - 1.5t. 45 - 1.5t is equivalent  (just it could be negative, but distance between brothers can be positive or negative) to |1.5t - 45|, though claim 5 could be more accurate by having the expression |45 - (2.5t - 1t)|. Because |1.5t - 45| is the distance between the brothers, the expression in Claim 5 is also the distance between the brothers.  Actually, because Claim #5 doesn't say anything about absolute value, it is kind of incorrect because distance should not be negative.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"VLlN4FlgXwxhlbJ5":{"id":"VLlN4FlgXwxhlbJ5","title":"Text 39","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #1\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I can tell the walking rate and y-intercept from the equation.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"tyDxYtNNeswXM3Em":{"id":"tyDxYtNNeswXM3Em","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #2  \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I can determine which of the two lines will be steeper from the equation. \"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"iEbzVg2xCg7r3VH_":{"id":"iEbzVg2xCg7r3VH_","title":"Text 40","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #3\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Both equations represent linear relationships. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"But, neither of them are proportional. \"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"_jqVN8QekMhcprkc":{"id":"_jqVN8QekMhcprkc","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #4\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I can find the time when Emile catches Henri, by setting the expressions for distance equal.\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"        D\"},{\"text\":\"Emile\",\"subscript\":true},{\"text\":\"   =   D\"},{\"text\":\"Henri  \",\"subscript\":true},{\"text\":\" \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"          2.5t  = 45 +1t\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Then find the value for t that makes the equation true.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"hIfn3H2jP1lVFurN":{"id":"hIfn3H2jP1lVFurN","title":"Text 41","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Claim #5\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I can use the expression \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"      45 – (2.5t – 1t)\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"to find the distance the brothers are apart for any given second t. \"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"BvoWiQjI6Y6mH5_A":{"id":"BvoWiQjI6Y6mH5_A","title":"Text 44","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Describe some strategies for solving problems that involve linear relationships. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"You can use a graph to see when the two lines intersect, and the slope will tell you the coefficient of the dependent variable (the y-intercept will represent additive values in the equation).

Because 74 minus 45 is 29, and Henri walks 1 m/s, it will take Henri 29 seconds to walk 74 meters. If we divide 74 by 2.5 (to find how long it would take Emile,  because he walks 2.5 m/s) , we get 29.6 seconds, meaning it would take Emile 29.6 to walk 74 meters. Therefore, Emile would be just slightly slower.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}}},"sharedModelMap":{"dW6zt5sC3KvW7uxf":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"dW6zt5sC3KvW7uxf","providerId":"K44q0BCcqvqqTsvl","dataSet":{"id":"8VySGk_UlYRKzg35","name":"Henri","attributes":[{"id":"rImottoho3-BWApY","clientKey":"","name":"Time (S)","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["0","1","2","10","25","35","50","100",""]},{"id":"uINpxIwRVBBl80sf","clientKey":"","name":"Meters","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{"display":"x + 45","canonical":"(__x__ + 45)"},"values":[45,46,47,55,70,80,95,145,null]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"0TVQZ85rKvPRUmfM"},{"__id__":"OTJ0JJOqTq53R4Xx"},{"__id__":"1tsja_liTH4V4yw2"},{"__id__":"3W9Qcd3dBFQF2Q9A"},{"__id__":"Z4BBhZzBGOQ-fKxb"},{"__id__":"yCWHbmBD5NFXMbt7"},{"__id__":"hiepX3fUI9UrzDlB"},{"__id__":"EEUbsI-Havv5oyo5"},{"__id__":"WYG8LWz0Gl3Hxuoz"}]}},"tiles":["zDvJSunW9Il6avLh","Upd_GX0s1z-4f_fH"]},"XK6vGVxLp5NoJT8L":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"XK6vGVxLp5NoJT8L","providerId":"WDzaIc3NthtE-_H0","dataSet":{"id":"ZAMEDmHYBVUgF7Qh","name":"Emile","attributes":[{"id":"xeVQL5KzgPdfInlE","clientKey":"","name":"Time (S)","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["0","1","2","10","25","35","50","100",""]},{"id":"FBc6MFA4wn-MPx9c","clientKey":"","name":"Meters","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{"display":"2.5 * Time (S)","canonical":"(2.5 * __x__)"},"values":[0,2.5,5,25,62.5,87.5,125,250,null]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"Dm10kTCcj5J0FvfS"},{"__id__":"Q4GKHkxQXjGoXJuV"},{"__id__":"D1FDB5YtlYwLnC7a"},{"__id__":"JLd6DyBMsrVrelss"},{"__id__":"RwFmsfNmITCsw0CP"},{"__id__":"rwKMdHGfDWbvzr-M"},{"__id__":"wlqRdWf8ITafZobu"},{"__id__":"kpAFsqFOwumGb73o"},{"__id__":"iEjn6IaVor7dORl8"}]}},"tiles":["zhRhB8_FJjyWas_O"]},"OGRPchSu8PmHVsEG":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"OGRPchSu8PmHVsEG","providerId":"g1kXWIceekqbggBW","dataSet":{"id":"xh9_56YsR66h-JN5","name":"Table 1","attributes":[{"id":"4X4dus6ZqN5nHWro","clientKey":"","name":"x","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":[]},{"id":"4tpf0ZpOSWXdkzsb","clientKey":"","name":"y","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":[]}],"cases":[]}},"tiles":[]}}}
