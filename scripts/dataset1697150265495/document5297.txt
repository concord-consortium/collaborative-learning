Half of that is 1.1125, and because money only goes to the 1/100 of dollars (cents), then we have to round to the nearest hundredth or 1.11. There is still the 1% portion of 6%, and 1% will just move the decimal place of 22.25 two spaces to the left, so 1% of 22.25 is 0.2225 (rounded to the nearest hundredth, and we can round up because we rounded down for the previous one), or after rounding, 0.23. 0.23 (1%) + 1.11 (5%) = 1.34 (6%). The tax on 22.25 dollars is 1.34, so the bill after tax is 22.25 + 1.34 or 23.59. We tip Larry's Lunch Place only 15 percent because they don't have Pepsi. 15 percent of the with-tax bill is 15 percent of 23.59. 15 percent is 10 percent + 5 percent, and 10 percent of 23.59 is 2.359. 5 percent of 23.59 is half of 10 percent of 23.59, or 2.359/2 = 1.1795. 2.359 (10%) + 1.1795 (5%) = 3.5385 (15%). Because, again, money only goes to hundredths, we round 3.5385 to the nearest hundredth, or 3.54. Adding 3.54 as a 15 percent tip to the pre-tip bill of 23.59, we get a final bill of $27.13. Because there are 3 people in our group, we split the bill 3 ways. 27.13 divided by 3 is equivalent to 27/3 + 0.13/3 = 9 + 0.13/3 = 9 + 0.04 (rounded down from 0.13/3) = 9.04.

For example, if the bill is x dollars and the tip is 15 percent, then we can express the final bill as: 1.15(x), or 1x + 0.15x. Again, because of the distributive property, we can further break down 1x + 0.15x to use Gil's method: 1x + 0.15x = 1x + 0.1x + 0.05x. If you add up all the coefficients of x, you get the coefficient of 1.15, so 1.15x, which is the same as calculating the tip directly. Therefore, Gil's method works. Bills: 15 percent of 24.50 is 10 percent of 24.50 + 5 percent of 24.50, which is 2.45 + 1/2 of 2.45 = 2.45 + 1.225 = 3.675, rounded to 3.68. The final bill is therefore 24.50 + 3.68 = 28.18 dollars. 20 percent is 2 times 10 percent, so if you gave 24.50 dollars a 20 percent tip, you would have a final bill of 24.50 + 2.45 * 2 = 24.50 + 4.9 = 29.40 dollars. For 17.35 dollars, 15 percent is 1.735 + 1/2 of 1.735 or 1.735 + 0.8675 = 2.6025 rounded to 2.60 dollars. 17.35 plus a 15 percent tip of 2.60 dollars is a total bill of 19.95 dollars. 20 percent of 17.35 dollars is 2 times 10 percent of 17.35, or 2 times 1.735. 2 * 1.735 = 3.47. 17.35 dollars plus a 20 percent tip of 17.35 dollars, or 3.47, gets a total bill of 20.82 dollars.\",\"marks\":[]}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"j5u_XHsY_-ZoBpQa":{"id":"j5u_XHsY_-ZoBpQa","title":"Text 6","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"object\":\"document\",\"data\":{},\"nodes\":[{\"object\":\"block\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"tag\":\"p\"},\"nodes\":[{\"object\":\"text\",\"text\":\"2.
