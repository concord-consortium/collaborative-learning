We can use a graph to find the number of km Alana walks if a sponsor donates $17 by finding 17 on the y-axis and looking to the right until we find the point with a y of 17 (the point where Alana earns $17).

The equation gives the information that the slope is 5, or you gain $5 for each km walked. The y-intercept, or additive change in the equation, is -3, suggesting that perhaps the walker is going to buy a $3 t-shirt for their sponsor. All of this is perfectly reasonable. However, Plan 2 is absolute baloney. The y-intercept is 6, so there is a fixed donation of $6. But because the slope is negative 1, that means the walker would LOSE money the farther they walked, which is completely messed up. Plan 3 also makes sense, because there is just a $2 fixed donation and you don't make more money the farther you walk (like Leanne). The slope is 0, because there is a 0 coefficient of x, and the y-intercept is 2 (additive value in equation). A table helps answer questions by providing specific points for $ and km. A graph helps by giving a good visual of the overall relationship, and an equation helps because you can plug in any number and get the right value for the other variable.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"IeQ15yLHbKcX1-oT":{"id":"IeQ15yLHbKcX1-oT","title":"Text 4","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Plan 1\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"  y = 5x – 3\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"6um9j6nFv0IqU8co":{"id":"6um9j6nFv0IqU8co","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Plan 2\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"  y = –x + 6\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"-nPq74oE3mb7fI55":{"id":"-nPq74oE3mb7fI55","title":"Text 5","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Plan 3\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"  y = 2\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"3TnRsj21eDFLpzaz":{"id":"3TnRsj21eDFLpzaz","title":"Text 6","content":{"type":"Text","text":"{\"object\":\"value\",\"document\":{\"children\":[{\"type\":\"bulleted-list\",\"children\":[{\"type\":\"list-item\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"What information does the equation give about the pledge plan?
