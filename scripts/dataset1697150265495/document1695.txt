Different areas of the primary motor cortex connect to, and control, movement of different parts of the body, forming a kind of body map known as the homunculus. The homunculus includes almost every single part of your body that can be controlled movement.  A large proportion of the motor cortex is devoted to our thumb, fingers, mouth and lips, as they are vital for manipulating objects and speech articulation. With a brain injury, some of the neurons connecting from your body part to your brain can break and never repair.  However, the brain can heal itself and regain some lost function through neuroplasticity. This means undamaged parts can change their connections and remap to other areas of the body to take over function, compensating for damaged parts of the motor cortex.\"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}},"7JO-BdH10IW9aERX":{"id":"7JO-BdH10IW9aERX","content":{"type":"Placeholder","sectionId":"reflection"}}},"sharedModelMap":{}}
