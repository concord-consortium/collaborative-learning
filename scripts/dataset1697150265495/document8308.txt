I know that the surface area of 3D figures must include all faces. You cannot have a total surface area without the top and bottom, for instance. If the surface area of a rectangular prism is 60 square inches, then that means that each of the 6 faces must have a surface area of 10 inches, or if there are 10 faces then they must have a surface area of 6 inches. This is applicable to any shape with any surface area. \",\"marks\":[]}]},{\"object\":\"block\",\"type\":\"line\",\"data\":{},\"nodes\":[{\"object\":\"text\",\"text\":\"2. I know that the volume of a 3D figure is calculated by doing length x width x height. For example, if the volume of a rectangular prism is 100 inches cubed, and it is 2x5x10, then it is 2 inches long, 5 inches wide, and 10 inches tall. I imagine there to be 10 layers of 10 square inches. This helps me picture the shape and why what I am doing works. So, in order to find the total volume you must layer on the layers until you reach the top, so you need 10. This means that the equation length x width x height is correct. \",\"marks\":[]}]},{\"object\":\"block\",\"type\":\"line\",\"data\":{},\"nodes\":[{\"object\":\"text\",\"text\":\"3. I have learned that sometimes it helps for me to take breaks and have a more flexible schedule while at the same time maintaining self control and understanding that I have to do work during the day so I don't have to do it later.
