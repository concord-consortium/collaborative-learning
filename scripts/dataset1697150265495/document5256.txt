Mirror Method: We know that the scale factor from the small triangle to the large triangle is 3/2.5, because the triangles are similar (two angles are the same, so the last angle is predetermined and there is only one way to make a triangle with 3 set angle) and 3 ft corresponds to 2.5 ft. 3/2.5 = 6/5 = 1.2, so the scale factor is 1.2. That means that the 60 inch height of the smaller triangle will be 1.2*60 inches on the larger triangles. or 72 inches. Shadow Method: The triangles are similar, assuming that the sun's rays are parallel, because we know that one angle is a right angle and the other two angles are the same because the sun's rays are parallel. If the triangles are similar, we can find the scale factor from the small triangle to the larger one by dividing the longer shadow by the shorter shadow, because the shadows are corresponding sides.
