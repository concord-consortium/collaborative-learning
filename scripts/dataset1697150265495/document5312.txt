Therefore, Team A had a better accuracy rate. Another strategy Sid could use is finding the GCF of 195 and 108 (how many they scored). It is 3, so Sid could divide both sides of both fractions by the number required to make both of their numerators 3. Because 108 (Team A) is 36 * 3, we must divide by 36 to get a numerator of 3. We also need to divide the denominator (126) by 3 to keep the rate of scored free throws to free throws. Therefore, Team A has a denominator of 3.5 for a numerator of 3, or it would take 3.5 free throws on average at the same rate of 108/126 to score 3 free throws. Because 195 (Team B) is 65 * 3, we must divide the numerator and denominator (257) by 65. Therefore, Team B has a denominator of around 3.95 for a numerator of 3, or it would take 3.95 free throws on average to score 3 free throws.

We know that a 1.4% decline of x results in 73.1 million, so 100 percent (1 whole) - 1.4 percent (decline from 2010 population to 2020 population) = 98.6 percent (percent of x that the 2020 population is). Therefore, 73.1 million = 0.986x, or 73.1 million = 98.6 percent of x. Dividing both sides by 0.986 to isolate the variable on one side, we get 74.1379310345 million = x. Because x is the 2010 population of people under 18, then the 2010 population of people under 18 will be 74,137,931 approximately. If the decline of people under 18 continued at this rate, then by 2030 the population under 18 is around 72.1 million, and then 2040 shows a population of around 71.1 million (as shown by the table and graph). The equation I used to find the population under 18 for any given year (even before the year 2000,  assuming the same rate continues) at the declination rate of 1.4% is f(Year) = 0.986 ^ ((Year - 2000)/10) * 75189655.1724... according to that, by the year AD 20000 the human population under 18 in the US will be so small it's basically 0. The reason why this equation works even before the year 2000 is because a positive number to the power of a negative number is still positive (for 0.986, is 0.986/0.986^negative 1 times the negative power).\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Puffins in Alaska: 2 puffins out of the 50 puffins the biologist caught were tagged, or 2/50 puffins. 2/50 is equivalent to 4/100 (multiplying both sides by 2 to get a denominator of 100), and because percent means per 100, 2 out of 50 is 4 percent (it is 4/100). Therefore, 4 percent of the puffins the biologist caught this summer were tagged. We can solve the second part of the problem using proportions: because 4% or 2 out of 50 puffins were tagged after last summer, we can assume that this applies to the total population and 4 percent of the population was tagged. Because the biologist tagged 20 puffins last summer, then 20 puffins should be 4% of the total population. Brushing aside other harder-to-predict factors, we have a proportion: 2 puffins/50 puffins = 20 puffins/x puffins. It is now a simple matter to see that 20 is 10 times 2, so the denominator of the second fraction should also be 10 times the first fraction's denominator. 50 * 10 is 500, so x = 500 and the population of the puffin island is approximately 500 puffins.\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Rising Ocean Levels and Erosion: The rate of square miles of land lost per year is 20 square miles per 15 years (the number of years between 1996 and 2011).

(20/15)/(15/15) is 1.3 repeating divided by 1, or 1.333... square miles of land underwater per each passing year. The period of time between 2011 and 2022 is 11 years, and if we multiply both sides of 1.333/1 by 11 to see the amount of land lost in 11 years, we get (1.333 * 11)/(1 * 11) = 14.666/11, so in 11 years or the amount of time between 2011 and 2022, 14.666 square miles of land will be lost.

The table has y = 12x as a unit rate (1 on the x side and 12 on the y side), which matches this situation. After finding the number of subscribers the Youtuber has now, we can scale up the unit rate from the table and find how many views the Youtuber has. Solution: The Youtuber now has 425,120 subscribers (101,700 + 323,420), and because views = 12 * subscribers, the Youtuber has 425,120 * 12 = 5,101,440 views. \"}]}]}}","format":"slate"}}},"sharedModelMap":{"BWrJoR_7i-mxcE6J":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"BWrJoR_7i-mxcE6J","providerId":"Uklotw3WymGXRtW3","dataSet":{"id":"T-VDP5RTE06Ep-mv","name":"Table representation","attributes":[{"id":"AfUogZQKINR7pZfD","clientKey":"","name":"x","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["1","5","10","15"]},{"id":"g5mZQ9_SGJwojUwu","clientKey":"","name":"y","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["12","60","120","180"]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"01GV3FFQEK10WRTYD16PM6VSDZ"},{"__id__":"01GV3FFQEK10WRTYD16PM6VSE0"},{"__id__":"01GV3FFQEK10WRTYD16PM6VSE1"},{"__id__":"01GV3FFQEK10WRTYD16PM6VSE2"}]}},"tiles":["xcw4DgrzrUm55dAB"]},"DbU5tWJYZIL5Zb86":{"sharedModel":{"type":"SharedDataSet","id":"DbU5tWJYZIL5Zb86","providerId":"_VdgF7hfbHzkYaW7","dataSet":{"id":"YLGcC6UnHOJEgjnF","name":"2020 Census Problem","attributes":[{"id":"EibydUTyhwKP7OaF","clientKey":"","name":"Year","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{},"values":["2010","2020","2030","2040","2050","2060","2070","2080","2090","2100","2200","2300","2400","2500","2600","2700","2800","2900","3000","4000","5000","6000","7000","8000","9000","10000","20000","1999","1950","1900"]},{"id":"EYN-izSpRmM548O1","clientKey":"","name":"People","hidden":false,"units":"","formula":{"display":"0.986 ^ ((x - 2000)/10) * 75189655.1724","canonical":"((0.986 ^ ((__x__ - 2000) / 10)) * 75189655.1724)"},"values":[74136999.9999864,73099081.99998659,72075694.85198678,71066635.12405896,70071702.23232213,69090698.40106961,68123428.62345465,67169700.62272628,66229324.81400811,65302114.26661199,56714798.30452765,49256725.95516308,42779400.16280276,37153851.434524365,32268069.939395532,28024775.290084302,24339479.601190925,21138805.25801736,18359023.90100889,4482714.514716096,1094542.3639511736,267253.9111181158,65255.26590866239,15933.348593458955,3890.4384782681577,949.9265935475089,0.000715492337841136,75295739.26464656,80681417.24601379,86574291.02314624]}],"cases":[{"__id__":"dmUACkIsatGzV7i5"},{"__id__":"t3Npv4pexRGwbufR"},{"__id__":"y7p-rzt0JN8HVTBG"},{"__id__":"qTb1SZYdg3PNBUQ2"},{"__id__":"62cYqINVVnZpivNc"},{"__id__":"tLiu2o0qFZ1RgbSH"},{"__id__":"t_tNn1oMsNhGGmn5"},{"__id__":"DjZqf9XFGEM3k9hc"},{"__id__":"3jhZZ5WQt_r2LRip"},{"__id__":"yQDDhAI4uQUteuXV"},{"__id__":"iwH_EMsqmIlRUeNk"},{"__id__":"zGmeXFQh_x_-F4Eq"},{"__id__":"Et9a1rjdFRilUDV7"},{"__id__":"DBqXrclNiY1WhJHh"},{"__id__":"JqXOLLD937p5VlAK"},{"__id__":"4hK2ZC93jBZS5eng"},{"__id__":"O0c2bhUurbIAauWw"},{"__id__":"4yGixXsYp5v6hEHA"},{"__id__":"cOQm70QsLgEHmBrq"},{"__id__":"2CC5lEo0d9rRwnCI"},{"__id__":"6uVzLvjOdspIDFO9"},{"__id__":"lMouS6PtoNHZwTh2"},{"__id__":"HIlZGXjQ1DKPK-hR"},{"__id__":"mW7_kgpCcQXS8Xda"},{"__id__":"KuAb8K-y8WFaE3Ay"},{"__id__":"7xDwQiI4nQaudtwi"},{"__id__":"POq6_rr4H0soJlc7"},{"__id__":"J4abkgX0gRSLwu2u"},{"__id__":"-E07pPLv_RZtsr8a"},{"__id__":"kro1wKHARmaPf-wh"}]}},"tiles":["ytsV4Q067cIJ8F63","CNMBeDJeSv2U6say"]}}}
