## Version 0.0.6 - released October 18, 2018

- Updates to UI including editability icons, group styling and new icons with hover behavior

## Version 0.0.5 - released October 16, 2018

- Spike: add image to geometry in curriculum [#161137053] - add support for images to geometry tool
- Support multiple tiles per row [#160634560] - drop tile at left or right edge of row (w/in 20px) to add tile to row - sized components (e.g. geometry tool) carry their size with them - deleting/removing a tile from a row resizes if there are no more sized components - tiles in row stretch to fill vertical height of row - drag handlers revert to using `clientY` rather than `pageY` since `pageY` reflects page scroll not element scroll
- Adjust default geometry tool height and grid size [#160864536]
- Image upload functionality (#105)
- Support dragging image tool to geometry to overlay image [#160604676] - image drop zone is central area more than 25 pixels from edge (to avoid conflict with tile drop zones) - only works for simple URLs (e.g. curriculum images) - no image upload support yet
